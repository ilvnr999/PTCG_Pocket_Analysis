US,1,2025-01-10,1.0.9,joeyyugioh,Fun but needs work,"The card collecting aspect is incredible! It’s very fun to be able to open packs of cards without breaking the bank. The idea of the app is great too, since I’ve never gotten into the gameplay aspect of Pokemon cards but it encourages playing. However, the online play needs a LOT of balancing. Everyone is using the same Mewtwo deck. If everyone aligns on the same deck that means it doesn’t have a competitive counter.

Update: They added more cards which diversified the gameplay and are making more events to keep everything fresh which are improvements. However, you can definitely tell that pulls are predetermined as you will get increased rare cards when you first join or if you come back after a long break. However, pulls stagnate and it has now been revealed that it could take up to 2 years to pull all the cards in the first set if you don’t pay any money. This is bad bc it has a direct impact on the cards you can use to duel, aka it’s pay to win.  Then there’s little quirks like promo packs allegedly being a random choice but I get the same card 5 times in a row. Or the auto AI throwing matches when it is poised to win. Honestly, if you don’t mind how fixed everything is then you might enjoy it. Personally, I think it’s a waste of time.","Fun but needs workThe card collecting aspect is incredible!

US,3,2025-01-10,1.0.9,Anonymous 90000000,"It’s excellent, but…","This game is excellent.  I haven’t played the physical TCG but I thoroughly enjoyed playing TCG on the Game Boy Color, which from what I understand is essentially an exact translation of the physical TCG onto the game boy, so this is my understanding of the TCG that I will be using to praise and critique TCG pocket.  

Things I love:
• The reworked energy system is awesome.  No more hoping you happen to pull an energy card from your deck, no more budgeting how many energies Vs trainers and Pokémon, no more concerns about running out of energy in long matches.  
• The constant events are really fun, and give plenty to do when you log in to collect your daily packs.  
• No major pay-to-win advantage.  While players who pay to open more packs will obviously have quicker access to more and often stronger cards, free-to-plays still get plenty of packs, hourglasses, and events to keep them on par with pay-to-plays.  Pokémon mobile games have always been pretty good on this, and TCGP is no exception.  

Things I’m mixed on:
• The deck size being 20 is both good and bad in my opinion.  It makes deckbuilding much similar and usually makes finding the cards you need easier, but it can be very limiting.  It’s not something I’d suggest be changed, but maybe have an option to play longer games with 4-6 points with 30-40 card decks, and keep the faster-paced 20 card decks as its own mode.  
• Only being able to bring two of each Pokémon/Trainer card as opposed to four is somewhat annoying, but understandable.  For twenty-card decks it’s fine, but if a larger-deck mode is ever implemented, this limit should be raised for larger decks.  I also don’t think it would be game-breaking for smaller decks, but I’m no expert on game balance.  

Things I hate:
• Not getting any energy on turn 1 when going first is devastating.  There are so many games that I have lost simply because of that energy disadvantage, and so many others I won because I had an energy advantage.  It’s so punishing that I often concede if I go first unless my hand is so good that I can work around it.  I imagine this was done to mitigate the first strike advantage that the player who goes first would have, but instead of resolving the problem it just gives an even bigger advantage to the person going second.  Why is the advantage bigger going second?  Because going second you can react to what your opponent is doing more effectively and better predict their moves.","It’s excellent, but…This game is excellent.

US,1,2025-01-09,1.0.9,jaydawg8,2 stars so you read!,"So, I want to say that I love this game, because I love pokemon tcg &amp; the original gameboy color game. It’s such an underrated card game! I originally gave this 1 star because I felt like it took away from the original card game, then I gave it 5 stars because I got into it &amp; the new play styles, as well as online battling (once I had enough cards I could build with). Now I’m giving it 1 star again because it’s starting to feel like beta testing rather than a launch. Not much has happened since launch, aside from 1 new set of cards. The battles are getting stale because there’s really only a few decks you could use (unless you don’t mind getting destroyed by the meta every other duel). New cards need to drop, there’s not many here, this limits deck building. To kill some time, you could offer more events and restricted battles. For example: a 3 star card cap. Or Anti-Ex league. Or multicolor decks only. You get the idea, limiting the cards we can use from this small batch will force players to be more creative. 

Right now, any deck based around PokemonEx will dominate. I’m tired of having to use my LaprasEx/Articuno deck, but it’s the only one that competes against other Ex decks (i just use 2 Lapras Ex, 1 articuno ex, and a regular lapras lol, no point in adding more pokemon cause theres only 3 points, might as well have my best at battle). Pikachu Ex &amp; Zapdos Ex is another easy winner as well as Mewtwo/gardevoir. Steel typing is currently useless, there’s like 5 cards, and no trainer/support cards to help. Now we have the celebi decks, but no one is really getting creative with Mew, it pretty much gets tacked onto the already overpowered Mewtwo deck. 

Dragonite is sick, and its great with eevee, but its rendered useless by the energy system. Multi-type decks are useless cause youre at the mercy of RNG with which energy you get. Ive been in situations where id win if i could pull the right energy, but ill have my dragonite loaded with thunder energy, and not get a water energy for 6 turns!!! How could you warrant playing a multi-type deck if you might just never get the energy you need. You should at least make it so it goes back and forth, like: water, thunder, water, thunder, etc. And now you added 1 more dragon, and it takes water+fire energy. I tried hard to figure out how to use it, but the only way to use it is to accept a lot of losses. 

Also we need to be able to collect more cards. 1 more pack a day for $10/mo isn’t really worth it, I rather wait to get more “thanks” from other players and use the shop to get hourglasses. I want to help out and support but I just can’t get behind the subscription, $120 a year for an extra pack a day, come on, this game isn’t worth more than Zelda lol, maybe make it $3/mo? I got bored of battling, so now I just casually log in and see if I get a pack or if there’s a wonder pick worth chancing my time. Hoping to keep collecting so that when you fix this game, I won’t be too far behind. Also, I see a lot of reviews about the RNG coin flips, originally I thought this was from salty players, but the amount of times I have my Celebi loaded with like 8+ energy and I only flip 1 heads is insane. 

I could be hooked to this game, I was for two weeks, now I’m bored. Y’all need to make some fixes fast, or this ones going forgotten. And just make the coin flips 50/50, really. The coin flips &amp; the good cards that require them almost feel useless because of how much anxiety people get from flipping 9 tails in a row. I mean come on, those odds are insane to happen in real life","2 stars so you read!So, I want to say that I love this game, because I love pokemon tcg &amp; the original gameboy color game. It’s such an underrated card game! I originally gave this 1 star because I felt like it took away from the original card game, then I gave it 5 stars because I got into it &amp; the new play styles, as well as online battling (once I had enough cards I could build with). Now I’m giving it 1 star again because it’s starting to feel like beta testing rather than a launch. Not much has happened since launch, aside from 1 new set of cards. The battles are getting stale because there’s really only a few decks you could use (unless you don’t mind getting destroyed by the meta every other duel). New cards need to drop, there’s not many here, this limits deck building. To kill some time, you could offer more events and restricted battles. For example: a 3 star card cap. Or Anti-Ex league. Or multicolor decks only. You get the idea, limiting the cards we can use from this small batch will force players to be more creative.

US,2,2025-01-09,1.0.9,Frank3293,Could’ve been excellent,"The pocket-sized gameplay is excellent, but before you get invested, there are some serious flaws. 

First, coin flips are not 50/50 - as some people on Reddit have demonstrated through counting numerous flips, th probability of tails is significantly higher, and some cards almost never yield heads (Misty). 

Second, a lack of good missions, varied rewards, player ranking system, rewards for winning, etc. make for dull gameplay. Missions and competitive rankings are standard components of a competitive card game, and I don’t see the point of launching a game before you have those systems in place. Compared to games like hearthstone and LoR, there’s little here that keeps you coming back. 

Third, the cap on buying hourglasses in the shop is ridiculous. The main currency of the game are shop tickets, but purchases are limited by MONTH. I don’t see the point of earning shop tickets if they just sit in my inventory for 20+ days each month. 

It really is a shame. I’ll return to the game intermittently hoping for updates, but if they don’t happen soon, I can’t imagine how this game could retain its players.

US,4,2025-01-08,1.0.9,Cassiopeia947,"Great, but needs work","I have a long history with card games, especially Pokemon TCG. I thought the smaller format of it would be a garbage fire, but all things considered it’s a great variation on the game. That being said though, there are some issues.

The balance and mechanics behind the cards are very hit or miss. The Celebi EX deck is really fun and dynamic, however it doesn’t take much effort to be firing off 100-300 damage per turn. That’d be fine on its own, but there aren’t a whole lot of options beyond just having good card-draw luck.

And Metal decks are borderline impossible unless you try to do something really niche. Which in a 60 card format isn’t bad, but in a 20 card format it genuinely feels like either you get a good first draw, or you lose.

The deck building is actually really fun. With less cards you can focus a lot more on the nuance of things like one Vaporeon or two in your deck (And yes it does matter). The drawback though with the current arsenal of cards is every deck is very one-note. Trying to make a fire deck that doesn’t include Moltres EX/Charizard EX is going to be frustrating. Sure you could use Blaine and the cards it affects, but in comparison to what you _could_ do it’s just very weak and hard to work with.

Psychic decks are likely always gonna use Gardevoir/Mewtwo EX, grass is Surperior/Celebi EX, water is Vaporeon/Misty/Gyarados EX, et cetera.

Supports are also hit or miss. The Brock card for example is really nice. It’s a fun lil burst of energy to help you out mid-match. However, it only works on Golem/Onyx. Golem is alright, but i can’t think of a situation where I’d rather build up Onyx rather than the other great fighting types in the game. It’d be great to have cards like this with less harsh limits to promote more creative deck-building rather than having the deck build itself, in a way.

All this being said though, i think this is a great version of the TCG game we know and love. When you aren’t fighting uphill against a exponentially-growing Celebi EX with 18 energy attached to it, it’s really fun and is a great way to ease people in to the 60-card version of the game. I really look forward to how this is developed in the future.","Great, but needs workI have a long history with card games, especially Pokemon TCG.

It’s a worthy replacement and helped me understand the TCG crowd all the more. It’s smooth, rewarding and strangely very generous to non-paying players, and even puts a cap on players who are overzealous with spending and collecting, helping keep the playing field more even.

The game isn’t perfect, but it’s a great start. There are some bugs on rare occasion that will force the app to restart, and I hope those kept fixed soon. One thing that I would suggest is to look at the difficulty level of some AI players more closely, as instead of them simply having great cards, they are guaranteed to have two or more cards to give them an advantage off the bat, which is quite an artificially inflated difficulty. This is a game where chance is your greatest foe, and that should apply to the AI as well. Also, the physicals of the coin flip should be reexplored as the initial coin flip can appear to act weighted, allowing tails to happen more than heads, and this is glaringly noticed in cards that require a head first flip to be of any real effectiveness. Otherwise, avoid using decks that depend on coin flips.

This is less of a criticism and more of a feature request. For the Wonder Picks, it would be quite helpful if we could filter by decks or deck portions (I.e., Mythical Island, Genetic Apex: Charizard, etc.). Many players at this point likely have received all or most of the pulls a particular deck offers, so it would be nice to not have to sift through those Wonder Pulls. 

The game is active with events and new cards, so one can go for quite a distance without feeling boredom. 

In short, this game has had a great start, but there’s room for improvement for this game to continue being great. From a new Pokemon Card game player to other Pokemon fans, give this game a spin.

US,4,2025-01-08,1.0.9,gg-goodvibes,Needs certain mechanics/cards,"I love Pokémon, I’ve been playing since red and blue on the game boy and have been an avid Pokémon TCG fan for over a decade and a half. I absolutely love this game and I feel like it’s a great way to introduce a tcg game to someone who’s never played one and give them the basis on how to play. I’ve already got a handful of my friends to download it and play and they too love it. But the main issues I see are a lack of gameplay mechanics that can allow for more competitive players to build with.

As someone who’s played the traditional Pokemon tcg and other card games like magic there are a few mechanics I wish we can get cards for and see hopefully in the future. Some ideas me and my friends have been spitballing have been : fossil support, color fixing and card draw. The damage numbers are fine as is (so please don’t make bigger attacks, we don’t need power creep) but support for different types of decks would be so fun. As of right now pikachu ex, mew two ex, charizard ex, celebi ex and garydos ex are all top tier decks, but I want to see non ex decks be more viable.

Color fixing should be the first thing, we’re in this single type deck meta that doesn’t allow for creative ways to use multiple types efficiently. I enjoy playing my dragonite deck, but it becomes totally useless when I get four to six energy in a row of the same type when it needs two types to work. A card like “professor’s letter” from the actual tcg would be a great add! In the tcg it lets you look up two basic energy cards and put them in your hand, allowing you to use multiple colored cards efficiently. The pocket version could be like “attach a energy of your choice to one of your Pokemon from your energy zone” a card like this would be great to play different colored decks.

Fossil support would be great too, a card that puts a fossil item card in your hand would be amazing! It would allow more players to use fossil Pokémon more consistently and let people use their favorite fossil Pokémon. Because as of right now no one uses them. They’re kinda pointless and too slow to play.

Also card draw, in magic we have a card called faithless looting. It basically allows us to draw two cards, but the cost is we have to discard a card. Some of this effect I think would be a great addition to the game, instead of relying on professors research or a couple of Pokemon attacks to draw cards.

I’d love to give this app 5 stars and it might change once we see more additions to mechanics, but the best I can give it is 4.","Needs certain mechanics/cardsI love Pokémon, I’ve been playing since red and blue on the game boy and have been an avid Pokémon TCG fan for over a decade and a half.

Love just how choosing and opening packs are done here. Collecting can get so addicting. The only problems I have are when it comes to the battling, cards can be very unbalanced. People run a select like 2-3 decks online and the game forces you to run these kinds of decks with the Advanced and Expert Singleplayer challenges. This game needs more cards for the battle system to be fully fleshed out, but we probably won’t see this fully realized until late this year or even next year. Don’t get me started on the coin flip mechanic. Online, it’s incredibly inconsistent unless you’re using a certain deck (like the top meta deck to run right at this moment) which grants you practically a large amount of coin tosses early in the game. Offline, the coin mechanic is stacked against you, assume the computer opponent is going to hit all of their coin flips because they absolutely will. Otherwise, battles are very fast, with most battles being decided within 10-15 moves.

US,2,2025-01-07,1.0.9,Henryk31,An average TCG simulator,"As indicated by title, this app is great if you’re looking for a water downed version of the standard Pokemon TCG. However there are significant gameplay flaws that lend this version of TCg to being entirely RNG dependent with almost zero ability for thoughtful PvP gameplay. 

Let me start by saying that the idea is great. The app captures the excitement of TCG with the ability to pull and collect EX and secret rare cards to show off on your profile to friends or the community. The wonder trade feature is also a fantastic addition, providing a chance at obtaining those rarer or elusive cards from other people who managed to pull them. They even include functionality for duplicates, allowing you to glamorize your cards with preview and battle effects. Lastly, they have an AI solo mode with tutorials that ease you into the game, making it easy to pick up and enjoy on the whim, however this is where the enjoyment ends for me.

If you’re looking for thoughtful TCG where every decision you make can make or break the difference between a win or loss, I’d suggest you play the standard Pokemon TCG instead, or simply another option. The TCG model adapted here is made to be blitz and quick, with games lasting effectively no longer than 10 min. Decks are 20 cards max and unsurprisingly the most popular and ‘meta’ decks are the EX decks which currently ALL lend themselves to significant RNG. Because of these features, most games tend to be decided by turn 3-4 where the luckier player top decks what they need to fully set up and knock out 3 of your Pokemon. Every game feels like a toss up between 4 popular decks, with virtually zero-counter play leading you to either accept your loss and concede or play the match out hopelessly to the guaranteed loss. 

Additionally, as is the nature of all mobile games, there is a paid currency that can be supplemented for pulling packs, making the game slightly pay to win if you don’t have those top deck cards, however this becomes less of a issue over a fairly small amount of time. Ultimately this is a fun, but average, TCG mobile app coming from one of the largest IPs on the planet, which is why I would rate it less than average compared to existing TCG mobile apps in the market. Hopefully the addition of new cards and perhaps game modes might solve these issues, but for now I do not recommend playing unless you enjoy the simplicity of collecting Pokemon cards and not battling.","An average TCG simulatorAs indicated by title, this app is great if you’re looking for a water downed version of the standard Pokemon TCG.

US,4,2025-01-06,1.0.9,~a nickname~,Great but I feel isolated,"Grew up collecting the cards but never battled. It’s so much fun! The app taught me how to battle and I’m doing really good!

 The only downside imo, is I feel very alone. 😔 I understand restricting messages for younger players, but I wish there was a way to be a part of the community more in-game. I would love to see what people got from my wonder pick. It shows me when someone thanks me, but not what they got. I would love to see what it was I gave them. Maybe even a “congrats” button. 

 I also think adding guilds/clans could help with the isolation-feeling. Perhaps guilds/clans could earn points for battles and receive rewards for their guild’s rank. Then of course, guilds can meet on Discord to communicate.

More content (besides more cards) would be great too. Battling gym leaders and gaining badges 📛, or events where we can battle Red, Blue, etc. More customization for our decks. I have multiple water decks (a gyarados ex deck, an articuno deck, etc.) yet there’s only one water-type color. More color shades please, more coins/playing mats, etc. More profile pic icons (there’s only 6?? Out of 1025 pokemon??). More things to purchase with shop tickets.

US,2,2025-01-04,1.0.9,HonestThoughtsOnThis,Attention duelists,"First and foremost, there is no trading in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I’m guessing when it does get added, it will disappoint a lot of people based on how limited the F2P model is. 

This game does a good job of sucking you in at first, but it slows down quickly. 

To be clear, you can slowly build up a collection over time and get most of the cards you want. Your overall luck opening/picking cards will determine what you can battle with while building up your collection, but that luck can vary wildly. 

The game is light on content and has already resorted to repeating its first few ideas. 
It makes me wonder if this game was pushed out early to cover for delays elsewhere in the franchise. They have tons of media they could reference for ideas and they’ve chosen to do only the most basic stuff. 

Battles are a large part of the experience if you aren’t spending money to open packs. The 20 card 2 copy limit offers its own pros and cons. Because of how limited the card pool is, the competitive aspect of the game is limited as well. Most battles are won based on playing two cards. They’re the only two cards that draw more cards, and if one person plays more of them, they’re probably going to win. Luck matters in all card games, but you can really feel it in this one. The game is up front about being casual though, so maybe the high variance is how they hope to achieve that. 

Evolutions require a unique card for each stage. Getting a basic, middle, and final evolution into play in sequence is tough with the limited card pool. Basically, high variance is (almost) everywhere. This will likely get better as more trainer cards and Pokémon with abilities come out. 

Even though battling others in PVP is the majority of the content right now, only the winning player gets a reward of 15 exp (not a lot), meaning if you start losing a game or just get a bad opener it’s reasonable to just concede and try again. There is no penalty for losses. This cheapens the overall experience for both sides. I don’t think they should add a penalty, but both players should be rewarded for completing a battle.

The F2P economy is a bit stingy. Two packs a day is great as a baseline, but the game doesn’t reward you much for actually playing. Daily missions give you additional pack every 3-4 days. If you level up you get a free pack. Packs contain five cards. 

Rarity also isn’t intuitive. Three diamond cards are more rare than most EX cards because EX cards often have alternate arts. This means you have more chances to see Pickachu EX than a Magneton because there are technically three different Pickachu EX cards that could end up in your pack.

Pack Points are the biggest issue for me and why I rate the game so poorly. I would be able to ignore the aggressiveness of the monetization if I was able to craft a few important low-rarity cards I can’t seem to open. 

I would love a way to convert duplicate cards into cards that I need. Five cards per pack with no guaranteed rares (three diamond of above) means you’ll have gaps in your collection unless you have exceptional luck. The majority of packs you open will just be one and two diamond cards.

I was missing a two diamond card despite opening 40+ of the pack it was in. This means I needed to spend a week of pack points to get one uncommon. Each pack opened gives 5 points and two diamond cards cost 70 points, meaning all your free packs for about a week (2/day is 10 pack points a day). I happened to open my third copy a day later, not a great experience as a F2P. I was saving my pack points to get an EX card for my starving family. 

Here’s an example of just how stingy they are with rewards. They gave away a few free packs as part of their holiday event. These packs did not give pack points when opened. They won’t even let players get 15~ free pack points for a yearly holiday event. 

Trading could also fix this, but it isn’t in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I’m guessing trading will be very restricted because they stand to lose way too much money if people can complete their collection through trading. My guess is that each account will get some number of free trades and the rest will cost Pokégold. I just don’t see them letting people trade without ‘taking their cut’. 

Wonder picks are the other side of the economy and it is just engineered FOMO at its worst. Showing you that you ‘picked’ incorrectly on failed attempts is definitely a choice when there are videos showing RNG is decided on packs and picks the instant resources are spent. You can and will get lucky, but the pool of cards is already large enough that finding even the right booster pack is a challenge. This is likely meant to be a catch-up mechanic for newer players and an occasional bonus for others. 

The UI needs work as well, it’s very barebones and not well organized. There are a lot of screens involved in obtaining cards that I wish were skippable. For another example, the best way to give your friends thanks is to go to the community display and scroll to the bottom. Going into the friends list to do the same thing requires 3 taps and some loading for each account manually. Deck building UI/search is also very poorly set up. 

Overall, it’s the most polished version of Pokémon Shop I’ve played, but they really need to fix the reward structure. I think the game has potential, but right now it feels like it’s an undercooked cash cow first and a game second.","Attention duelistsFirst and foremost, there is no trading in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet.

Pack Points are the biggest issue for me and why I rate the game so poorly. I would be able to ignore the aggressiveness of the monetization if I was able to craft a few important low-rarity cards I can’t seem to open. 

I would love a way to convert duplicate cards into cards that I need. Five cards per pack with no guaranteed rares (three diamond of above) means you’ll have gaps in your collection unless you have exceptional luck. The majority of packs you open will just be one and two diamond cards.

I was missing a two diamond card despite opening 40+ of the pack it was in. This means I needed to spend a week of pack points to get one uncommon. Each pack opened gives 5 points and two diamond cards cost 70 points, meaning all your free packs for about a week (2/day is 10 pack points a day). I happened to open my third copy a day later, not a great experience as a F2P. I was saving my pack points to get an EX card for my starving family. 

Here’s an example of just how stingy they are with rewards. They gave away a few free packs as part of their holiday event. These packs did not give pack points when opened. They won’t even let players get 15~ free pack points for a yearly holiday event. 

Trading could also fix this, but it isn’t in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I’m guessing trading will be very restricted because they stand to lose way too much money if people can complete their collection through trading. My guess is that each account will get some number of free trades and the rest will cost Pokégold. I just don’t see them letting people trade without ‘taking their cut’. 

Wonder picks are the other side of the economy and it is just engineered FOMO at its worst. Showing you that you ‘picked’ incorrectly on failed attempts is definitely a choice when there are videos showing RNG is decided on packs and picks the instant resources are spent. You can and will get lucky, but the pool of cards is already large enough that finding even the right booster pack is a challenge. This is likely meant to be a catch-up mechanic for newer players and an occasional bonus for others. 

The UI needs work as well, it’s very barebones and not well organized. There are a lot of screens involved in obtaining cards that I wish were skippable. For another example, the best way to give your friends thanks is to go to the community display and scroll to the bottom. Going into the friends list to do the same thing requires 3 taps and some loading for each account manually. Deck building UI/search is also very poorly set up. 

Overall, it’s the most polished version of Pokémon Shop I’ve played, but they really need to fix the reward structure. I think the game has potential, but right now it feels like it’s an undercooked cash cow first and a game second.",Neutral

Anyways—-the AI you play against in the game if you choose “solo”, flip heads almost every coin flip they get.

I’ll literally watch the AI coin flip on its edge, sit there for a sec, then use-the-force-Luke its way onto the heads side. Infuriating. What is this, a casino?

Covers for binders.. These images clash with card art making playing a game with someone who has one of these monstrosities a jarring experience.

Just starting, you’re facing people who have zero ambition outside of a damp shame basement, and the only satisfaction they get out of a poor excuse of existence is playing the easiest possible level where the “BEGINNERS” are. Because getting their rear ends kicked by someone their own level is unfathomable, and WILL NOT BE TOLERATED! Therefore they stick to an easy target and make the game unenjoyable for any potential “new” players. 

I suggest level 15 and up has to play intermediate and above.","Low life high rollersAny level can do beginner matches?? This could have been a really good game.

US,1,2025-01-03,1.0.9,outangina,"Nearly Perfect But,Very Void Of Its Potential,It Can Be Fulfilled!","I’ve really enjoyed playing the Pokémon TCG app, but honestly, it feels unfinished—like we’re testing out a beta instead of the full game. Don’t get me wrong, the core gameplay is solid, and it’s fun to collect cards and battle, but there’s so much untapped potential that could make it truly amazing. For starters, let us create and join our own Gyms. Players could design badges or emblems, set unique battle rules, and let others challenge their Gyms for rewards or reputation. This could even operate in a tiered league format, like Pearl-Diamond rankings, adding a competitive, social layer to the game that’s currently missing. Daily AI challenges could also be expanded to include Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, villains, and iconic characters from all Pokémon games, manga, and anime. These battles could be time-based or turn-based, offering exclusive cards or rewards for completing them. The harder the battle, the better the reward. This would keep things fresh and exciting, giving players a reason to come back every day. To make it even more dynamic, there could be a system where different AI characters are available each day, cycling through a massive roster. Each AI could have a themed hub that’s only accessible on certain days. For example, on Mondays, you could battle any Elite Four member because their hub is open, with each character offering different difficulty levels. The hubs themselves could also vary in difficulty—an easy opponent in a harder hub would still present a challenge compared to a weaker hub’s toughest trainer. With the resources and abilities your team has, I’m sure you could design a logical and engaging balance for this system. Another great addition would be avatar customization. Let us design our own trainers, with unlockable outfits and accessories inspired by Pokémon lore. Seeing a personalized avatar interact during battles would bring more personality to the game. A Pokémon anime-style story mode could also elevate the experience. Whether it uses PNG cutouts or 3D rigs like in Pokémon Masters, adding a storyline where we face off against rivals, Gym Leaders, and villains would make the game feel immersive and rewarding. Even better, you could let us revisit old narratives like those in Diamond, Pearl, Gold, Ruby, and HeartGold/SoulSilver. Instead of playing as Ethan, for example, we’d run into him at iconic moments in his story, making us feel like part of the larger Pokémon universe. Right now, the card pool feels too limited. Battles get repetitive because everyone ends up using the same decks. Bringing back unique cards like Delta Species, retro sets, or event-exclusive collections would add diversity and make encounters more interesting. Tournaments with real prizes would also be a fantastic addition. Players could pay an entry fee, with premium members competing exclusively to avoid any issues with seeming like gambling. This would make competition more intense and give players something exciting to aim for. A possible addition could be NFTs as tournament or clan war prizes. While I understand this involves giving away wealth or assets to fans, you’d also gain significant returns in engagement and loyalty. Updating the terms and conditions to fairly—but favorably—incorporate this system could make it a win-win. NFTs could be exclusive trainer cards, badges, or collectibles that build prestige within the game’s community. Another area of potential is the code card system. The current system could be enhanced by allowing physical cards to transfer into the game through a shard mechanic, where cards redeemed online represent a fraction of the physical card, or by creating exclusive in-game packs tied to physical promo cards. This would incentivize purchasing physical cards while keeping the digital format fresh. Additionally, linking Pokémon GO and Pokémon Masters could create cross-game rewards. For example, walking ten miles in GO might unlock a full-art Lugia in TCG, or logging 10 hours in Masters could earn a full-art Arceus. These kinds of challenges would encourage players to engage across all Pokémon titles while earning meaningful rewards. Finally, the premium membership could include more expensive tiers or season passes, like in COD Mobile, where milestones unlock rewards as players progress. A system like this could allow players to open more packs, but with the current generosity of the game balanced by a much larger card pool, it wouldn’t feel overpowered. Filling the Pokédex would still be challenging, even for paying players, creating a balanced, rewarding experience. Overall, the Pokémon TCG app is fun but feels like it’s only halfway done. With more set options I would feel more comfortable rating this a 5 I&#39;ll give it 4/5 even tho I said 5 to be more visible originally I got no response so I&#39;m changing it to 1/5 because after getting good at the game if I run into celebi even if I play better I lose there is no luck factor the card is overpowered compared to zapados and it&#39;s not even because the extra energy cost it&#39;s like celebi is too broken if I have that card I can&#39;t lose unless I&#39;m playing against fire and the player is good or I&#39;m playing against the same deck and they got lucky or was better. There’s so much room for improvement, and these features could make it the definitive way to experience the Pokémon TCG. If you need someone to help ideate, conceptualize, or manage these kinds of projects, feel free to reach out to me on Instagram at @artist_supportteam. I have the ability to come up with creative, logical ideas that cater to both the player and the consumer while keeping everything practical for developers &amp; optimizing profits for you.

US,4,2025-01-03,1.0.9,Kool__Thing,"Good Game, One Problem","I’ve been opening packs for years, and although it can be fun it’s always expensive. This game allows anybody collect cards for free, which is amazing and feels good to know your money isn’t wasted when you don’t pull anything good. (Not to mention the art/art rares are insanely beautiful! Of course you won’t pull one every pack, but that makes it feel better when you do.)

However, the public battling is where I have issues. The game lists everyone a “beginner” even when they’re up to level 40 or so. I’ve gotten opponents nearly 20 levels above me, and that makes it challenging for me and many other players who aren’t as experienced. Because of this problem I’ve lost tons and tons of battles, and not just because I’m a bad player who doesn’t think things through too far ahead, but because my opponents have had more time to play and collect better cards than me.

I’m not sure if there’s a direct solution to this, but I would prefer if there could be levels of experience, and you could battle people on just your level or in that range. 

It’s been so much fun to play and gather all of the special rares, see collections come together, see battles be completed, trophies earned, decks made, and to get amazing wonder picks. And, when public battling, you only have to wait a few seconds to find a match, so that’s always nice! 

Despite my earlier complaints, I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who loves Pokémon or is interested in collecting the cards — or both. The game has been worth my time so far, so maybe it’ll be worth yours too!","Good Game, One ProblemI’ve been opening packs for years, and although it can be fun it’s always expensive.

You can not set any energy on your first move if you go first and your opponent may be able to set numerous energies depending on their deck during their first turn, many times leaving you unable to attack until your third turn while they get free shots at you.

Multiplayer is ruined because of one card.  1 out of 10 battles is against someone not using a deck built around this card which can knock out any card in one turn like 500 attack so you don’t stand a chance.  My other issue is opening boosters is great and you do get good cards but it seems like I always get the same ones good or bad.

If premium was a $10 one time purchase, or somewhere around $2/mo I would probably subscribe, &amp; in turn play the game more. 

Hopefully as the game expands &amp; more cards/packs are added, we are able to open more packs per day.

US,3,2025-01-01,1.0.9,Tamari Simms,Bots flip heads 95% of the time,"Will first off say that this is a great game and it’s been a joy playing it.

Anyways—-the AI you play against in the game if you choose “solo”, flip heads almost every coin flip they get. The point of a random chance mechanic is only novel if it’s actually random; NOT weighted. In comparison my own coin flips are about 40/60 (can’t complain in that department), but it means nothing when the AI has an automatic higher heads-rate. Like it should be a legitimate 50/50 chance; the AI isn’t a “better” coin-flipper cause there’s NO way to be a “better” coin-flipper. HENCE THE PURPOSE OF A TRUE 50/50.

I’ll literally watch the AI coin flip on its edge, sit there for a sec, then use-the-force-Luke its way onto the heads side. Infuriating. What is this, a casino?

In all honesty I’ll probably keep playing, it’s just something that really keeps me from LOVING the game.","Bots flip heads 95% of the timeWill first off say that this is a great game and it’s been a joy playing it.
