To be clear, you can slowly build up a collection over time and get most of the cards you want. Your overall luck opening/picking cards will determine what you can battle with while building up your collection, but that luck can vary wildly. 

The game is light on content and has already resorted to repeating its first few ideas. 
It makes me wonder if this game was pushed out early to cover for delays elsewhere in the franchise. They have tons of media they could reference for ideas and they‚Äôve chosen to do only the most basic stuff. 

Battles are a large part of the experience if you aren‚Äôt spending money to open packs. The 20 card 2 copy limit offers its own pros and cons. Because of how limited the card pool is, the competitive aspect of the game is limited as well. Most battles are won based on playing two cards. They‚Äôre the only two cards that draw more cards, and if one person plays more of them, they‚Äôre probably going to win. Luck matters in all card games, but you can really feel it in this one. The game is up front about being casual though, so maybe the high variance is how they hope to achieve that. 

Evolutions require a unique card for each stage. Getting a basic, middle, and final evolution into play in sequence is tough with the limited card pool. Basically, high variance is (almost) everywhere. This will likely get better as more trainer cards and Pok√©mon with abilities come out. 

Even though battling others in PVP is the majority of the content right now, only the winning player gets a reward of 15 exp (not a lot), meaning if you start losing a game or just get a bad opener it‚Äôs reasonable to just concede and try again. There is no penalty for losses. This cheapens the overall experience for both sides. I don‚Äôt think they should add a penalty, but both players should be rewarded for completing a battle.

The F2P economy is a bit stingy. Two packs a day is great as a baseline, but the game doesn‚Äôt reward you much for actually playing. Daily missions give you additional pack every 3-4 days. If you level up you get a free pack. Packs contain five cards. 

Rarity also isn‚Äôt intuitive. Three diamond cards are more rare than most EX cards because EX cards often have alternate arts. This means you have more chances to see Pickachu EX than a Magneton because there are technically three different Pickachu EX cards that could end up in your pack.

Pack Points are the biggest issue for me and why I rate the game so poorly. I would be able to ignore the aggressiveness of the monetization if I was able to craft a few important low-rarity cards I can‚Äôt seem to open. 

I would love a way to convert duplicate cards into cards that I need. Five cards per pack with no guaranteed rares (three diamond of above) means you‚Äôll have gaps in your collection unless you have exceptional luck. The majority of packs you open will just be one and two diamond cards.

I was missing a two diamond card despite opening 40+ of the pack it was in. This means I needed to spend a week of pack points to get one uncommon. Each pack opened gives 5 points and two diamond cards cost 70 points, meaning all your free packs for about a week (2/day is 10 pack points a day). I happened to open my third copy a day later, not a great experience as a F2P. I was saving my pack points to get an EX card for my starving family. 

Here‚Äôs an example of just how stingy they are with rewards. They gave away a few free packs as part of their holiday event. These packs did not give pack points when opened. They won‚Äôt even let players get 15~ free pack points for a yearly holiday event. 

Trading could also fix this, but it isn‚Äôt in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I‚Äôm guessing trading will be very restricted because they stand to lose way too much money if people can complete their collection through trading. My guess is that each account will get some number of free trades and the rest will cost Pok√©gold. I just don‚Äôt see them letting people trade without ‚Äòtaking their cut‚Äô. 

Wonder picks are the other side of the economy and it is just engineered FOMO at its worst. Showing you that you ‚Äòpicked‚Äô incorrectly on failed attempts is definitely a choice when there are videos showing RNG is decided on packs and picks the instant resources are spent. You can and will get lucky, but the pool of cards is already large enough that finding even the right booster pack is a challenge. This is likely meant to be a catch-up mechanic for newer players and an occasional bonus for others. 

The UI needs work as well, it‚Äôs very barebones and not well organized. There are a lot of screens involved in obtaining cards that I wish were skippable. For another example, the best way to give your friends thanks is to go to the community display and scroll to the bottom. Going into the friends list to do the same thing requires 3 taps and some loading for each account manually. Deck building UI/search is also very poorly set up. 

Overall, it‚Äôs the most polished version of Pok√©mon Shop I‚Äôve played, but they really need to fix the reward structure. I think the game has potential, but right now it feels like it‚Äôs an undercooked cash cow first and a game second.","Attention duelistsFirst and foremost, there is no trading in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet.

Anyways‚Äî-the AI you play against in the game if you choose ‚Äúsolo‚Äù, flip heads almost every coin flip they get. The point of a random chance mechanic is only novel if it‚Äôs actually random; NOT weighted. In comparison my own coin flips are about 40/60 (can‚Äôt complain in that department), but it means nothing when the AI has an automatic higher heads-rate. Like it should be a legitimate 50/50 chance; the AI isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù coin-flipper cause there‚Äôs NO way to be a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù coin-flipper. HENCE THE PURPOSE OF A TRUE 50/50.

I‚Äôll literally watch the AI coin flip on its edge, sit there for a sec, then use-the-force-Luke its way onto the heads side. Infuriating. What is this, a casino?

In all honesty I‚Äôll probably keep playing, it‚Äôs just something that really keeps me from LOVING the game.","Bots flip heads 95% of the timeWill first off say that this is a great game and it‚Äôs been a joy playing it. And no, this isn‚Äôt a review to cry and whine about Celebi or Mewtwo.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the core gameplay is solid, and it‚Äôs fun to collect cards and battle, but there‚Äôs so much untapped potential that could make it truly amazing. For starters, let us create and join our own Gyms. Players could design badges or emblems, set unique battle rules, and let others challenge their Gyms for rewards or reputation. This could even operate in a tiered league format, like Pearl-Diamond rankings, adding a competitive, social layer to the game that‚Äôs currently missing. Daily AI challenges could also be expanded to include Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, villains, and iconic characters from all Pok√©mon games, manga, and anime. These battles could be time-based or turn-based, offering exclusive cards or rewards for completing them. The harder the battle, the better the reward. This would keep things fresh and exciting, giving players a reason to come back every day. To make it even more dynamic, there could be a system where different AI characters are available each day, cycling through a massive roster. Each AI could have a themed hub that‚Äôs only accessible on certain days. For example, on Mondays, you could battle any Elite Four member because their hub is open, with each character offering different difficulty levels. The hubs themselves could also vary in difficulty‚Äîan easy opponent in a harder hub would still present a challenge compared to a weaker hub‚Äôs toughest trainer. With the resources and abilities your team has, I‚Äôm sure you could design a logical and engaging balance for this system. Another great addition would be avatar customization. Let us design our own trainers, with unlockable outfits and accessories inspired by Pok√©mon lore. Seeing a personalized avatar interact during battles would bring more personality to the game. A Pok√©mon anime-style story mode could also elevate the experience. Whether it uses PNG cutouts or 3D rigs like in Pok√©mon Masters, adding a storyline where we face off against rivals, Gym Leaders, and villains would make the game feel immersive and rewarding. Even better, you could let us revisit old narratives like those in Diamond, Pearl, Gold, Ruby, and HeartGold/SoulSilver. Instead of playing as Ethan, for example, we‚Äôd run into him at iconic moments in his story, making us feel like part of the larger Pok√©mon universe. Right now, the card pool feels too limited. Battles get repetitive because everyone ends up using the same decks. Bringing back unique cards like Delta Species, retro sets, or event-exclusive collections would add diversity and make encounters more interesting. Tournaments with real prizes would also be a fantastic addition. Players could pay an entry fee, with premium members competing exclusively to avoid any issues with seeming like gambling. This would make competition more intense and give players something exciting to aim for. A possible addition could be NFTs as tournament or clan war prizes. While I understand this involves giving away wealth or assets to fans, you‚Äôd also gain significant returns in engagement and loyalty. Updating the terms and conditions to fairly‚Äîbut favorably‚Äîincorporate this system could make it a win-win. NFTs could be exclusive trainer cards, badges, or collectibles that build prestige within the game‚Äôs community. Another area of potential is the code card system. The current system could be enhanced by allowing physical cards to transfer into the game through a shard mechanic, where cards redeemed online represent a fraction of the physical card, or by creating exclusive in-game packs tied to physical promo cards. This would incentivize purchasing physical cards while keeping the digital format fresh. Additionally, linking Pok√©mon GO and Pok√©mon Masters could create cross-game rewards. For example, walking ten miles in GO might unlock a full-art Lugia in TCG, or logging 10 hours in Masters could earn a full-art Arceus. These kinds of challenges would encourage players to engage across all Pok√©mon titles while earning meaningful rewards. Finally, the premium membership could include more expensive tiers or season passes, like in COD Mobile, where milestones unlock rewards as players progress. A system like this could allow players to open more packs, but with the current generosity of the game balanced by a much larger card pool, it wouldn‚Äôt feel overpowered. Filling the Pok√©dex would still be challenging, even for paying players, creating a balanced, rewarding experience. Overall, the Pok√©mon TCG app is fun but feels like it‚Äôs only halfway done. With more set options I would feel more comfortable rating this a 5 I&#39;ll give it 4/5 even tho I said 5 to be more visible originally I got no response so I&#39;m changing it to 1/5 because after getting good at the game if I run into celebi even if I play better I lose there is no luck factor the card is overpowered compared to zapados and it&#39;s not even because the extra energy cost it&#39;s like celebi is too broken if I have that card I can&#39;t lose unless I&#39;m playing against fire and the player is good or I&#39;m playing against the same deck and they got lucky or was better. There‚Äôs so much room for improvement, and these features could make it the definitive way to experience the Pok√©mon TCG. If you need someone to help ideate, conceptualize, or manage these kinds of projects, feel free to reach out to me on Instagram at @artist_supportteam. I have the ability to come up with creative, logical ideas that cater to both the player and the consumer while keeping everything practical for developers &amp; optimizing profits for you.

I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a direct solution to this, but I would prefer if there could be levels of experience, and you could battle people on just your level or in that range.
