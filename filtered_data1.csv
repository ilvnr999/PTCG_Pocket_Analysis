It feels a little unbalanced. Then the flair option. I obtain my flair but I can’t even see it when scrolling through my deck. I would love to see what has flair what doesn’t.

This has so much potential if they can resolve the small issues and carefully prevent power creep when new cards are released!

I appreciate some of the changes from the base game they have made, the matches are generally faster, the smaller deck sizes help with consistency, and the lower point total for a win make it feel more strategic to protect your EX from knockouts.

The coin flip having human interaction seems like it could be exploited with input macros, it would be best if this was done automatically and with shorter animations.","Poor balance for early setBe prepared for most matches to come down to coin flips.

I’ll literally watch the AI coin flip on its edge, sit there for a sec, then use-the-force-Luke its way onto the heads side. Infuriating. What is this, a casino?
