Not that is has released,  I am not sure why they added it at all. I could not be more disappointed. It‚Äôs literally the worst system you can imagine. This is not a trading game at all. You have to spend a fair amount of money if you want to get enough cards to break down for trade tokens so you can actually trade. So, if you are okay spending a lot of money to trade, this game is for you. Or, if you don‚Äôt plan to trade, you may like the game. If you are like me and were hoping to complete sets by trading, and perhaps spending a few bucks here and there, this is not the game for you. Unless this changes, I think they will lose a lot of people.","Trading is horribleI enjoyed the game at first, while excitedly holding out for the trading system to go live .

Seeing how the new trade mechanic works not only seems greedy but dysfunctional. They expect us to get rid of our highest rarity cards for a small fraction of token recovery. For instance a single 4 diamond card costs 500 tokens to trade for. you then give up one of your own 4 diamond as is customary in Pok√©mon trading. In order to build up that many tokens to trade for this card will require a sacrifice of at least four 4 diamond cards. That comes out to a loss of five 4 diamond cards to get one. Those sacrifices will only ensure either trading fails to gain traction altogether or people will simply have to keep spending more money opening packs to build their stock of extras. Both are not ideal for anyone. Until they make fixes the game is downright broken.,Trading is atrociousThis game already felt a little too openly greedy with its other conversions.

I don‚Äôt like the idea that spinning the booster packs to pick one doesn‚Äôt matter where it lands on because it‚Äôs already set from the moment you picked the booster set. 

I love the idea of adding trading. Don‚Äôt like the fact that the common cards that are one and two diamonds can‚Äôt get these tokens at all. Should at least give you 1 or 5 trade tokens. Also love the idea that you can have global trading but the one thing that should be added to trading is the ability to put on your profile the pokemon cards you need or want most. 

Maybe the ability to post your top 3 most desired cards you‚Äôre looking for so when someone from a global trade can see so you have a better chance to get what you need or want. Or set it up like the DS games like Pokemon Diamond and Pearl when you can post what you offer and what you want for everyone globally to see so the odds are better to trade. 

The trading system of this game seems to be where this company wants to make things really hard for people to enjoy especially when you already can‚Äôt trade without these tokens for the rarest cards and not all rare cards can be traded. So something should be done to update the trade feature. Trading is near to impossible in this game. 

Also should add the ability to put nicknames on your friends to help identify who is who. Can‚Äôt always remember who the person is just by the name they picked for the game.

You would think, given the literal name of the game (TRADING Card Game), that they‚Äôd at least make trading functional, let alone fair. But no, what we got is a clunky, restrictive, borderline predatory system that seems designed purely to frustrate players into spending money rather than actually enjoying the game.

Let‚Äôs start with the most glaring issue: the absurd costs associated with trading. In every other Pok√©mon TCG game (and literally every card game with a trading system), the concept is simple‚Äîplayer A gives player B a card, and in return, player B gives something of equal or agreed-upon value. But here? Oh no, that would be too reasonable. Instead, we get a system where players need Trade Tickets, a painfully limited resource that is, of course, available in convenient microtransaction bundles! Because why implement a good, balanced feature when you can monetize the absolute life out of it?

Oh, but it gets worse. The restrictions on what you can actually trade are ridiculous. Not all cards are eligible, meaning you might not even be able to trade the cards you want. And if you do find someone with a trade offer that interests you, guess what? You better hope you have the exact card they want in return, because there‚Äôs no real negotiation system. No free-market trading, no way to set up open-ended deals‚Äîjust whatever arbitrary nonsense the developers have decided is ‚Äúfair.‚Äù

And let‚Äôs not forget the fact that the whole system is designed to be as slow and tedious as possible. Instead of a quick, efficient process, trading is buried under layers of UI menus, confirmations, and time-gated nonsense that makes it feel like you‚Äôre filling out a mortgage application instead of swapping digital cards in a mobile game. Who thought this was a good idea?

It‚Äôs clear that Pok√©mon TCG Pocket‚Äôs trading system wasn‚Äôt designed for players‚Äîit was designed for profits. It‚Äôs an anti-player, anti-fun mechanic that exists solely to push microtransactions and force players into spending real money on ‚Äútrading resources.‚Äù Instead of fostering a healthy in-game economy or building a strong trading community, they‚Äôve created a system so restrictive and frustrating that it actively discourages trading altogether.

This could have been such a simple, enjoyable feature. Just let players trade freely. Let us swap cards like we did as kids on the playground. Let us build collections organically instead of shoving arbitrary restrictions and cash-grabs in our faces. But no, The Pok√©mon Company and Creatures Inc. have, once again, taken the laziest, greediest route possible.

At the time of this review you need to destroy FOUR ex cards just to trade for ONE. 

Due to the insane number of trading tokens needed just to do a single trade, trading really only benefits the people who have dumped huge of amounts of money in the game and have a huge excess of high rarity cards.

It‚Äôs an entirely backwards system because if someone has dumped a ton of money in the game, it‚Äôs highly likely that they already have all the cards they need anyway and thus have no reason to trade. As a result free to play and casual players (likely the largest postulation of Pok√©mon pocket players), are ones losing with this horrible update.

The predatory trading token requirements also render card augmentations and effects useless. It is a really cool way to show the breadth of your card collection. But now we have to basically forget about card augmentations altogether just to allow us to piece together the duplicate cards needed to make a single trade.","Trading System is pointlessI have been playing this game pretty much since launch.

I know this game has the wonder pick system and a really really bad craft system to help compensate for this, but the fact that Hearthstones single player crafting system is cheaper to use than a multiplayer trading system in this game. In hearthstone, you can burn 4 cards to craft any card of the same value by yourself. In this game, you have to burn 5 cards to TRADE something of the same value. It‚Äôs just awful. 

And you can‚Äôt trade 2* and above. 

Just let us trade cards of equal rarity without burning a card to do it, and/or make the exchange rate close to the inverse of what it is now.

There would have been a time where I might have paid money to a good game with a respectable economy just to show support. It will not happen with the game in this state. The greed is extreme.","Trading cost is INSANELY GREEDYWhy.

We waited 2 months for trading, now we can‚Äôt trade cards at all without burning more cards. On top of that, 2 more convoluted tokens to manage and clog up rewards. 

Oh, and also there‚Äôs no system at all for communicating with other players, or even communicating what cards you‚Äôre looking for. If you want to make any meaningful trade, you have to communicate on an outside platform, add them with a friend code (friend codes in 2025 lol).

Absolutely trash, either the devs are incompetent (likely) and/or trading is purposely impossible because it forces people to buy more packs ($ also likely).

But limiting trading to just friends and creating many roadblocks to trade by trying to create new currencies that can be bought with real money. Is showing its real face, the app is not a way to reward long fans of the series but to slowly pull you in with sketchy and bad implementations to collect cards. Trading is something that is already costly as a collector since you need to give up something to get what you want, but trying to create a complex system of trading to make you spend more money than a subscription is just not worth it. As for me, and I am sure many other players will probably stop using this app if trading is just this bad.","New trading system is really badI was so excited for this app as a collector not wanting to battle or spend hundreds of dollars for the physical cards.

Oh, but don&#39;t worry, they added ANOTHER in-app currency to help! I really enjoy the game, but we deeply need more 3rd party oversight and regulation when it comes to games like this.",Neutral

This brought back the good times and memories of that game. I love that there are unique cards only for this mobile game. I don‚Äôt like the idea that spinning the booster packs to pick one doesn‚Äôt matter where it lands on because it‚Äôs already set from the moment you picked the booster set. I love the idea of adding trading. Don‚Äôt like the fact that the common cards that are one and two diamonds can‚Äôt get these tokens at all. Should at least give you 1 or 5 trade tokens. Also love the idea that you can have global trading but the one thing that should be added to trading is the ability to put on your profile the pokemon cards you need or want most. Maybe the ability to post your top 3 most desired cards you‚Äôre looking for so when someone from a global trade can see so you have a better chance to get what you need or want. Or set it up like the DS games like Pokemon Diamond and Pearl when you can post what you offer and what you want for everyone globally to see so the odds are better to trade. The trading system of this game seems to be where this company wants to make things really hard for people to enjoy especially when you already can‚Äôt trade without these tokens for the rarest cards and not all rare cards can be traded. So something should be done to update the trade feature. Trading is near to impossible in this game. Other than that it‚Äôs a fun and exciting game. I play this game when I‚Äôm not playing Pokemon Go and I play Pokemon Go when I‚Äôm not playing this TCG Pocket.

Please consider changing the system to be somewhat more balanced than what is currently in place. The current system requires a player wanting to trade to trash 4 copies of a card of the rarity they want to trade (on an arrange) and then trade another copy of the same rarity. Essentially requiring you to ‚Äútrade‚Äù 5 cards for 1. 

My recommendation would be to allow cards of all rarities to be scrapped for the trade dust or reduce the trade dust requirements to something more manageable. 

I like many other players feel like this misses the point of the trading aspect altogether. 

Additionally, the game has no current way to even let your friends know what card(s) you are looking for and essentially requires you to rely on a third party method for communicating outside of the game. I understand there are safety concerns for allowing a chat function, but at least something in place (my recommendation would be the wishlist function already in the game) where your friends can see what cards you are looking for.","Trading is a huge letdownI was loving this game up until recently when they released the trading feature and it has completely ruined the nostalgia feel of the trading aspect of Pokemon that I remember back when the card game first released.

US,3,2025-01-30,1.1.0,El Franco 10,Trading is currently for no one,"Pocket claims to be a TCG and I was very excited that a digital card game would include the feature. As the feature is implemented now it is too restrictive to your average player. Getting trade tokens is too resource intensive on top of being stamina restricted. The needed sacrifice of multiple of a rare card just to trade a single  one of the same rarity makes it so you would need many extra cards to trade. This creates a scenario where the only people who could benefit from trade are people with many many duplicates (enough to discard for tokens and enough to trade) . These theoretical bad luck whales would the need to find a friend who would want to trade with them the exact card they need.

As the feature is implemented now it is too restrictive to your average player. Getting trade tokens is too resource intensive on top of being stamina restricted. The needed sacrifice of multiple of a rare card just to trade a single  one of the same rarity makes it so you would need many extra cards to trade. This creates a scenario where the only people who could benefit from trade are people with many many duplicates (enough to discard for tokens and enough to trade) .

Editing this review to complain about trading system implemented on this date. It‚Äôs an insult to the player base and should not have been added in its current state

First, I want to start this review by saying that this game is an amazing start. It is incredibly fun to play, doesn‚Äôt feel pay to win, and brings so much joy for pokemon fans especially those of us who never really had a chance to play with the cards we had. That being said I am not giving it 5 stars because there are many updates and changes that I would love to see from the developers.

1. Trading would be a godsend. The app says it is coming in a future update, but still adding it here because we want it.

2. Please give us something to do with extra cards. When I draw my 6th weepinbell or  ponyta or whatnot it‚Äôs just not very engaging. I would love a way to convert cards we don‚Äôt want into pack hourglasses!

3. The premium pass is to expensive for what it offers. I‚Äôve been thoroughly enjoying the 2-week free trial of the pass and would love to support the app by buying it. That being said $10 per month for an extra pack (every 24 hrs instead of 12 mind you) and some bonus quests is terrible value. For a subscription like this I would not be able to justify anything over $5 a month if that, hopefully the devs lower the price.

4. I would really love to see a wider variety of quests, battles (both solo and vs events), and battle rewards. As it stands, the game feels like something that is extremely rewarding to play early-on, but rapidly dips in quality as you complete all the battles and their respective challenges that are currently available. I want more!

Hopefully this gives devs ideas for where to take the game, and I hope we get many future updates.","Fantastic Start, Needs MoreEdit: Wed Jan 29

Myself and many other players waited for the ‚Äútrading‚Äù part of ‚ÄúPockemon Trading Card Game‚Äù to become true for 3 months. Well today it has been released and it is the worst implementation I could imagine.

1.) there is STILL no way to communicate with other players. So how it works is you select a player, and put up one of your cards to exchange. You can‚Äôt tell what cards this other person has. They then put up a card of the same value since it has to be the same. And then you see they are trading you a card that you already have multiple of. There is no messaging system or anything relating to communication. The only way to relay what cards you want is to know the person already. Cannot speak to other players.

2.) Instead of just 1 arbitrary currency added like we all expected and accepted would probably be implemented, they added 2. Not only are you restricted to 1 trade every 12 hours due to a new system of ‚ÄúTrade Stamina‚Äù, but you also have to ‚Äúburn‚Äù other rare cards to turn them into currency called Trade Tokens. If you want to trade an EX card for example, you need to burn TWENTY 3 diamonds cards. You have to throw away a huge amount of rare cards to get to trade a single card.

So not only do you have to sacrifice a bunch of rare cards and wait 12 hours, you also have no way of knowing what cards your trading partner has unless you know them outside the game and can talk to them irl.

All in all I‚Äôm cancelling my premium membership because I was most excited to trade but it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt want you to be able to trade with friends to collect all the cards, they want you to keep buying packs with money over and over instead.","Trading Added, UnusableI‚Äôve been playing since the day it launched.

A mobile-friendly way to collect cards, play quick battles, and enjoy the nostalgia of the Pok√©mon TCG? Sounds great on paper. But now that trading is finally here, it‚Äôs clear that The Pok√©mon Company‚Äôs priority isn‚Äôt creating a fair and engaging system‚Äîit‚Äôs protecting their own pack sales.

The problem? The entire trading system is restrictive to the point of being nearly useless. Instead of fostering a real player-driven economy, it feels like an artificial way to push people toward spending money on packs. There‚Äôs no true open market, and the hoops you have to jump through just to trade feel intentionally designed to limit your options.

Rather than encouraging meaningful trades between players, this system safeguards The Pok√©mon Company‚Äôs bottom line. A true trading system should allow flexibility, fair value exchanges, and player freedom‚Äînot be another paywall disguised as a feature.

Unless they overhaul this completely, trading in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket is a massive failure. What could have been a great addition is instead just another frustrating, corporate-controlled system designed to squeeze more money out of players.

There‚Äôs no true open market, and the hoops you have to jump through just to trade feel intentionally designed to limit your options.

Rather than encouraging meaningful trades between players, this system safeguards The Pok√©mon Company‚Äôs bottom line. A true trading system should allow flexibility, fair value exchanges, and player freedom‚Äînot be another paywall disguised as a feature.

Unless they overhaul this completely, trading in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket is a massive failure. What could have been a great addition is instead just another frustrating, corporate-controlled system designed to squeeze more money out of players.

Final Verdict: Trading is a bust. Fix it or scrap it!",Negative

US,1,2025-01-29,1.1.0,Jacob90118,New trading system has taken my love for this game,"I was looking forward to the new trading system. It seemed like it would be a great way to fill out our collections when it comes to some of those pesky missing cards.

Instead of simply being able to trade cards between friends as desired, possibly forcing you to trade equivalent rarity cards at the most, you have to trade any cards above 2 diamond rarity (aka the most useful cards in a decent deck) using tokens.

These tokens are earned by permanently deleting duplicate cards of three diamond rarity or above from your collection. This would already be a very annoying feature in a game without micro transactions, but this game allows you to spend real money to buy gold, which can then be used to buy packs.

The new trading system is making players that buy packs, including myself, throw away cards that they exchanged real money for in order to make trades, and that, to me, is simply not acceptable. It feels like an extremely money-hungry move on the part of the developers, and I feel foolish for having ever spent money on this game in the first place.

I will not be making the mistake of spending money on this game in the future if the developers don‚Äôt make serious changes to the trading system. I have already cancelled my premium pass, and certainly won‚Äôt be utilizing the trading system in its current state, and quite frankly, if nothing ends up changing, I am very likely to delete this app and find something else to occupy my time.","New trading system has taken my love for this gameI was looking forward to the new trading system.

TLDR: this game is a money grab for nostalgic millennials. It‚Äôs too slow, and too biased toward pay-to-play, while also being the most expensive pay-to-play game I have ever seen. 

Additions: 

Changed to 1 star because the in-game purchases are predatory. If you spend real money to get gold, the gold cost of ‚Äúten packs‚Äù will increase, forcing you to purchase more to try and afford it. Not okay. 

The versus battling has nothing to help casual players. There are 2-3 toxic deck strategies that are used by the majority of players online, making battling extremely un-fun and difficult to progress because versus is the only way to consistently gain experience points and progress. 

Trading is completely unusable. The barrier of entry is so high, that the average player can only afford to do a few trades period. 

‚Äî-
Let me start out by saying I absolutely adore this game. I will be a player for the foreseeable future.

That said, the reward system needs rebalancing, and the coin flip odds are not 50/50. 

First, many of the rewards you receive can only be exchanged for things that don‚Äôt help you advance in the game. Second, there are many things that do not give you experience that logically should, making it difficult to progress. Third, there are not enough ways to earn pack hourglasses after you reach a certain point in the game. I used to be able to open 5‚Äì6 packs per day, now I can only open the one or two given each day because I have cleared all of the solo battles that give pack hourglasses.

On the coin flip subject, certain cards appear to have different odds. Additionally, the very first coin flip dramatically influences the rest of your results. If you get heads first, you often get mostly heads. If you get tails first, often times you get all tails. Very irritating.","Highly IrritatingOriginal review below.

I was really excited for the trading update because I thought it would help me fill out my collection. This was not the case. I‚Äôm happy to change the one star if this ever gets fixed, but the current state is asinine. 

Major points:

- cannot view friends‚Äô wishlists/wishlist cannot be viewed by friends 

- no player-to-player in-app communication for coordinating trades

- trade token consumption and exchange rate flagrantly unbalanced 

- single trade request at a time tedious and frustrating 

Overall, the system is borderline useless to all players regardless of total playtime. With no way to communicate or display the cards we are looking for, it feels like an expensive shot in the dark every time, even when tokens and stamina aren‚Äôt consumed by rejected trades. The real price is time and patience.  

Ways to improve:

- make wishlists public, integrate into trading UI

- make trade tokens far more available

- treat trade token ranking like qualifier (must exchange however many rarer cards gets them to 500 tokens, but this nets them permanent access to all current trading rarities instead of being consumable on trade)

- scratch the token system entirely in favor of shinedust or only trade stamina 

- improve UI to include multiple trade requests at once (preventing the same card from being involved in more than 1 request)

As Trading was Recently Introduced (as of the Writing of this Review), we were finally able to See what we would be able to Aquite through the System and it seems that the Higher Rarity Cards (2-Star, 3-Star &amp; Crown Rares) along with Promos ARE NOT Tradable‚Ä¶ While I can understand the logic behind the decision, especially in regards to the Higher Rarity cards, I don‚Äôt understand why Promos were also Included‚Ä¶ Massive Middle Finger to any players who didn‚Äôt begin playing from the Very Start of the Game, as they‚Äôve yet to do an Event that had Repeat Rewards from Previous Events. Also, on the topic of Promos‚Ä¶ The Pull Chance is extremely janky in my opinion. The Pull Probability just doesn‚Äôt seem to line up with the Stated Probabilities. For example, one event with 5 Promos, I opened 25 Packs and only received 1√ó Copy of 2 of the 5 Promos, while getting Half a Dozen of the Highest Rarity Promo for the event. I‚Äôve seen countless other people that have had similar happen to them as well. 

The Pack Pull Probabilities also seem to follow a skewed or slightly rigged (not in the player‚Äôs favor). While I know that I‚Äôve yet to reach the statistical probability for Crown Rares for the First 2 Sets (I‚Äôve Opened roughly 700 packs across the two sets), I‚Äôve yet to see a Crown rare meanwhile I‚Äôve got 5-8√ó Copies of some of the Other Higher Rarity Cards. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Also the CPU for Solo Battles, especially on the Expert Difficulty, seems to always have the advantage (at least 95% of the time at least). Always have the right cards in their opening hands, always hitting the best odds on Coun Flips, etc while I always Miss my Coin Flips a vast majority of the time or consistently draw bad hands. Again, just doesn‚Äôt add up. 

The events are a bit lackluster, not very engaging which I somewhat understand as the game only has so much for the players to do but regardless it would be nice to have some unique and engaging events from time to time. 

I do hope that the game continues to get better and hopefully make some of the elements I‚Äôve mentioned a bit better.

For example, one event with 5 Promos, I opened 25 Packs and only received 1√ó Copy of 2 of the 5 Promos, while getting Half a Dozen of the Highest Rarity Promo for the event. I‚Äôve seen countless other people that have had similar happen to them as well. 

The Pack Pull Probabilities also seem to follow a skewed or slightly rigged (not in the player‚Äôs favor). While I know that I‚Äôve yet to reach the statistical probability for Crown Rares for the First 2 Sets (I‚Äôve Opened roughly 700 packs across the two sets), I‚Äôve yet to see a Crown rare meanwhile I‚Äôve got 5-8√ó Copies of some of the Other Higher Rarity Cards. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Also the CPU for Solo Battles, especially on the Expert Difficulty, seems to always have the advantage (at least 95% of the time at least). Always have the right cards in their opening hands, always hitting the best odds on Coun Flips, etc while I always Miss my Coin Flips a vast majority of the time or consistently draw bad hands. Again, just doesn‚Äôt add up. 

The events are a bit lackluster, not very engaging which I somewhat understand as the game only has so much for the players to do but regardless it would be nice to have some unique and engaging events from time to time. 

I do hope that the game continues to get better and hopefully make some of the elements I‚Äôve mentioned a bit better. Only time will tell.",Negative

US,2,2025-01-29,,EarthNinja444,Good at first but went downhill so fast,"When I started this game in October, it was really fun, not just as a way to learn to play the physical game, but on its own was a nice, balanced (sort of) game.

As of January 29th a day before the launch of SpaceTime Smackdown, I can no longer say this is the case. The trading system is horrendous, as I need to essentially get rid of 4 EX cards to get one secret rare I&#39;ve been missing after months of opening packs. Of the cards I&#39;m missing, most of them can&#39;t even be obtained through trades, further making this feature useless. Keep in mind that there are around 50 2* secret rates right now, and there will be close to 70 tomorrow. I haven&#39;t missed a single day opening packs, and I only six of them.

I&#39;m completely fine with rare cards on the packs, I think it&#39;s a great thing to have cards you&#39;re chasing after, but making them this unobtainable, and adding more of them at a rate I can&#39;t keep up with is very frustrating.

There used to be a workaround to this, which is that people who opened god packs would have online servers where people could friend them to get just one of these 50 cards, but now this is being monitored by the developers, who have put a notice out essentially threatening repurcussions should someone god forbid try and get all the cards in a pack without selling a kidney (seriously, it takes an estimated 2-3 thousand USD to get every card).

Lastly, with the new cards coming tomorrow, I&#39;m a bit upset that they&#39;ve neglected to add certain ones. For example, Infernape only has an EX version, and no regular version, while the other starters Torterra and Empoleon don&#39;t have an EX version, and only a regular version (note that these are intended to be a trio). Unlike Genetic Apex (the first large set of cards) where any EX also had a regular form, in this new set (SpaceTime Smackdown), if a Pokemon has an EX, they don&#39;t get a regular form. This is also very frustrating, as it discourages new decks from emerging (such as how a lot of psychic decks use both Mewtwo and Mewtwo EX at the same time), as well as failing to live up to the precedent Genetic Apex set, as it really feels like they were cutting corners with this new release, and the game isn&#39;t even 3 months old yet. Also, I should add that while all 8 gym leaders had a card in Genetic Apex, this is not the case for SpaceTime Smackdown, where less than half have one.

If the game ever does turn around for the better, I&#39;d be happy to change this review. If you asked me a month ago what my thoughts were, it&#39;d be at least a 4/5, if not higher. The two star rating right now is only because the battle system is still mostly fun, if not very repetitive and unrewarding.","Good at first but went downhill so fastWhen I started this game in October, it was really fun, not just as a way to learn to play the physical game, but on its own was a nice, balanced (sort of) game.

US,1,2025-01-29,,Matt20264,A tcg with bad(no) trading,"I just picked up this game last week. I‚Äôve always wanted to get into Pokemon tcg in an affordable way and this more or less scratches this itch. I was willing to deal with time gates and some currencies to deal with. And I pretty much expect micro transactions in games if you want them. The time gates aren‚Äôt horrible and you can actually get a pretty solid collection going pretty quick for free. There‚Äôs no but there either, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. You CAN pay to get packs faster but I can wholeheartedly say you don‚Äôt feel like you need to. We call that balanced. Great stuff so far. 

But you‚Äôre reading this for the title, and trading just released today and after reading the terms I‚Äôd hardly call it trading. Go to reddit, people are upset. Rightfully so. They put another time gate and another currency just to access it, but the currency you only get through turning cards in. On top of that you can only trade one card at a time and the cards MUST be the same rarity. I know why they did all of this. 1. To make money. But they have some very easy moneymaking strategies with the wonder pick and booster packs and it fits there just fine. You get cards no strings attached, no destruction of your collection if you just wait. And you can get good cards without grinding much at all. So that leads to 2. They don‚Äôt want people trading for real world money, in game. It‚Äôs actually against their ToS. If trade were unrestricted people could pay others for cards. And while I find that silly for virtual, no-value cards, it‚Äôs also what people do in real life without Nintendo throwing a fit really. If my friend wants to give me a high tier card for free, why stop them? What is Nintendo really losing out from? I‚Äôm still going to play, you kind of have to? 

The battles are, I think, fine. As with anything a bit of luck is required, sometimes you‚Äôll lose just because of the order that you draw out cards but if you build your own deck you can go crazy, some balancing may be needed but it‚Äôs fine. I like being able to play a computer still too, that works well enough. I can tell that this probably isn‚Äôt even close to the amount of cards that are out there, it‚Äôs still a fairly new game on phone so no big deal there.

Overall the game has a lot of a good stuff and once massive glaring problem for a trading card game; a greedy company. If we can cut that out and free up the trading process you‚Äôve got a pretty easy 4 to 5 star game. And I hope the devs read this and take it seriously.

- Don‚Äôt alert me that I can open a pack every single time I click on a different expansion set.
- Make the noise that alerts me that I can open a pack substantially quieter, it genuinely hurts my ears.
- Get rid of status effects / coin flips that effect the opposing Pokemon from popping up when the opposing Pokemon has just fainted.
- Shorten the timer to opponents being AFK to 45 seconds at one time and 75 seconds total rather than only 120 seconds at one time. When someone does this three within a day they are unable to battle for the remainder of the day.
- If someone concedes more than four times in a single day they should have a thirty minute cooldown, with another hour cooldown for every concession after that (I‚Äôm targeting the people who concede within seconds of losing here)
- Just reformat the UI a little bit to clean things up a bit, the game feels like it should have a bit more liveliness to it.

You cannot trade full arts, secret art ex, gold, or immersive cards‚Ä¶.. the cost to trade a basic ex is waaaay too high. 

The variety of cards is terrible. The fact that they split a single set up into numerous subsets is ridiculous and obviously predatory trying to get people to buy the already overpriced currently. 

They made the trading mechanic so horrendous as to ward off people that want to make money off the game, but have driven EVERYONE off from it entirely. Just get rid of trading or make it more accessible. 

Deeply disappointed in the terrible decisions made by DeNa.",Negative

US,1,2025-01-29,,Nicketysplit181,Trading Launch is Abysmal,"I have been eagerly awaiting the trade feature since I began playing this game (about a week after launch) and the developers have totally botched it. It is so sad because up until now the game has been so fun and from a deck-building and gameplay perspective. Up until this point the game has been very wallet-friendly and building a few solid decks just playing the solo missions and opening the daily packs was feasible. With more cards entering the game this barrier to entry would ultimately get even higher, but myself and many others saw trading as the thing that would keep the FTP players on the same playing field as the big-spenders. Unfortunately this flawed trade system does not seem to benefit either of these types of players. The FTP people do not have enough extra copies to burn to trade for the cards that actually matter (4 diamond ex cards). People who spend a good chunk of money of the game are already going to have all of the cards 1 star and below so trading for them is essentially useless. It seems this system was not designed for any player, but rather to be restrictive in order to force players to spend money on gold. I understand that some limitations for trading must be in place to prevent account hopping and re-rolling but this seems way too extreme. I went from extremely eager to see the new cards and swap for the last few I needed from the old set with my friends but trading (in this form) has killed my enthusiasm. 

Potential Resolutions: 
-Remove the trade token system. Restrictions on how often one can trade and forcing traded cards to be the same rarity already combat account farming.
-If trade tokens are non-negotiable, drastically improve the conversion rates for destroying cards. Destroying a rare card should allow me to make multiple trades. Players essentially have to trade 5 cards for 1 in the current system and this just makes no sense. 

At the very least the company seems to be open to feedback so if this reaches anyone who can do anything about this know that I love your game and want to keep playing it. This is extremely disappointing but I would love to come back soon and leave a positive review if this is changed. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this.","Trading Launch is AbysmalI have been eagerly awaiting the trade feature since I began playing this game (about a week after launch) and the developers have totally botched it.

US,1,2025-01-29,,Pavis11,Full of Hoopla,"Every action in this game takes way too long: from opening packs, to flipping coins, to wonder picking cards.  There are unskippable cut scenes (often back to back) that give the player the illusion of choice or influence over random events.

There are no less than and sometimes more than 5 different screens required to view to open a single pack.  This gets annoying fast.

Occasionally, the game offers free wonder picks (a system that allows the player a chance to receive 1 card of 5).  These free wonder picks are almost not even worth the time it takes to redeem them.  Very often the reward for this is a single wonder pick hourglass.  This hourglass is essentially a 1/12 to 1/48 of a 20% chance to get a card you want (if you are lucky enough for it to even appear in a wonder pick selected by the game).

In 2025, a ‚Äútrading‚Äù feature was added to the game.  It is so restricted that it renders the system basically unusable.  And I can only guess it was added to make the game technically a TCG (trading card game).  This adds another TWO currencies to the game where there are already at least 10 different ones.

Additionally, a game with a white background theme with no optional dark theme released in 2024 is laughable.","Full of HooplaEvery action in this game takes way too long: from opening packs, to flipping coins, to wonder picking cards.

I understand a higher barrier to entry for trading rare cards, but, in the current system, it will cost discarding multiple rare (three star or higher) cards to complete a single trade for anything higher than two diamond. Two and one star diamond also cannot be used to offset this. This is a wildly inflated cost.

The second gigantic issue is there is no way to telegraph what cards you are hoping for or need, the trade is essentially random and there is no way to communicate what you need in the app.

US,1,2025-01-29,,hoveros,TCG is good but App is terrible,"The actual gameplay of Pokemon TCG is maybe the most approachable version of the card game. It‚Äôs simple and relatively short gameplay allows for anyone to just jump in and play.

But the actual game is hidden behind a confusing UI and a purposefully obtuse UX involving somewhere between 5-8 in game currencies. 

The biggest offender is the new trading system. It‚Äôs terrible. Not only does it not actually explain effectively how trading works but effectively, in order to make trades, you have to destroy your own cards. Yes. You destroy cards to gain points. Accrue enough points and you are allowed to request a trade for a rare card. This DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU WANT it is only the first step in being allowed to trade. 

On top of this, the conversion rate of destroying cards is terrible. Trading an EX card which are the most sought after competitive cards in the game requires a user DESTROY FOUR of their own EX cards to be allowed to trade. This is a confusing and mean system that incentivizes poor decision making on the player‚Äôs part. Limiting trading is fine. But this is too much. And is the single worst implementation of in game currency I‚Äôve ever experienced in my years playing online card games.","TCG is good but App is terribleThe actual gameplay of Pokemon TCG is maybe the most approachable version of the card game.

US,1,2025-01-29,,Droolit County Sherrif,Pokemon Deep Pockets,"The implemented trade system is a sign of things to come. The developers intend to produce a streamlined game of card battling that, while fun, will never offer the same depth as the Live version. This game had promise despite these issues, the deck building had a surprising amount of nuance. 

Then they implemented a ridiculous trade system. It was bad enough that everything in this game operates on a timer, there are like 15 different currencies you keep track of for various timers. The newest is a three-part trading system, that was welcome by the community until it came. 

Let me explain, this won‚Äôt be confusing at all:  First, you need to acquire stamina to make a trade, you only can accrue up to five at a time. Then, of course, you need to own cards to trade (d‚Äôuh) you can‚Äôt just trade a card to another player you want to trade with. You also need to collect multiple copies of the card you want to trade away, so you can exchange them for a pile of tokens exclusive to trading that particular card (you‚Äôll need four or more!) and then and o it then can you trade it (provided the player on the other end did the same). Also, you are not permitted to trade the very rarest cards.

Why would you introduce such a hamfisted structure? Clearly to drive sales, but I can‚Äôt help but think about all the hours devoted to creating something that was so obviously wrong nobody in their right mind would consider using. And the irony is‚ÄîI liked spending money on this game before! Now I am totally not. Will be uninstalling after I check out the new cards.

US,1,2025-01-29,,Swiftmadethat,A Complete Disaster ‚Äì Pok√©mon Trading in Name Only,"I‚Äôve been a huge fan of Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket since its release. The thrill of collecting Pok√©mon, opening packs, and building a deck is fantastic‚Äîbut the greed behind this game‚Äôs economy has finally crossed the line.

The recently introduced trading system is, without exaggeration, one of the worst implementations I‚Äôve ever seen in a card game. Instead of fostering fair player-to-player exchanges, it‚Äôs designed to be yet another money sink. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a disaster:

1. Burning Excessive Cards Just to Trade ‚Äì Want to trade one EX Pok√©mon? Get ready to sacrifice six other EX Pok√©mon in return. This is absurd. What kind of trading system forces players to destroy valuable cards just to make an exchange? This isn‚Äôt trading‚Äîit‚Äôs an exploitative recycling mechanic disguised as a feature.

2. Severe Restrictions on Card Rarity ‚Äì You can‚Äôt even trade 2-star and above cards? Seriously? The whole point of a TCG is to collect and trade all kinds of cards. This arbitrary restriction is a blatant attempt to force players into spending more money instead of organically obtaining the cards they need through fair trades.

3. Trade Tokens ‚Äì A Paywall in Disguise ‚Äì As if the absurd card-burning system wasn‚Äôt bad enough, you also need trade tokens to even initiate a trade. These take time to accumulate, making the whole process even more frustrating. So, not only are players losing multiple cards just to make one trade, but they also have to wait and grind for tokens? That‚Äôs beyond unreasonable.

The entire Pok√©mon TCG Pocket community is rightfully outraged by this. A trading system should bring players together and encourage strategic collecting‚Äînot penalize them with ridiculous restrictions and hoops to jump through. Pok√©mon Pocket needs to listen to its player base because, right now, they‚Äôve completely alienated the community that actually funds this game with their hard-earned money.

Until major changes are made, I can‚Äôt recommend engaging with this trading system at all. It‚Äôs a blatant cash grab that prioritizes corporate greed over player enjoyment.

What a shame.  Trading could have been such a huge highlight of this app if designed properly.  Instead, the restrictions feel like the focus was on boosting profits rather than design a great experience for users.  I could definitely see this backfiring and leading to users spending less money on the app.

I can imagine this is why trading was not included when the app was originally launched.

How to improve trading:

1.  Users should be able to trade cards without throwing away duplicate rare cards.

2.  Either use stardust for trades, or no currency at all.  The new trading currency is a horrible idea.  You basically have to trade in / destroy multiple rare cards for trade tokens.  Why not let common cards be traded in?  It&#39;s so poorly executed.

US,1,2025-01-29,,Yeeethan,Trading is restrictive slow and unenjoyable,"This might be my first review.

The trade mechanic is one of the worst things I‚Äôve seen in a game that‚Äôs centered around trading.

It alienates new players. It‚Äôs slow and grindy. I‚Äôve been playing since day one and am at over 3000 cards. Having to dispose of cards I have collected to trade for cards that it feels like this game gas refused to give me through pulling packs is a farce. It makes me want to stop playing.

Having to sacrifice a five star card to trade a 3 star card is wild and unfair. The pull rates do not justify this sort of punishing mechanic. On the other side of this the tokens received for exchanging cards is too low. 25tokens for 3 diamond and 125 for ex is insulting. 

Trading should be based on cooldown and rarity only. Burning up your cards is nothing but a money grab. 

On top of all of the other hour glasses and cool downs it‚Äôs bogging this game down and is a turn off for casual collectors.

The stamina cooldown is too slow as well and makes trading unenjoyable, again a trading game in which you can trade but you can‚Äôt do it often and there‚Äôs caps and limits. 

There needs to be a wants/needs list for cards so you can see what your friends need.

Please re evaluate as this will drive away players.

US,2,2025-01-29,,LiamLogsdon,This is because of the recent update for trading,"The trading has finally been implemented and is very underwhelming. The system for trade tokens (not hourglasses) is ridiculous. Having to breakdown duplicates of cards to get tokens to trade higher rarity cards, such as ex cards, which are NECESSARY to complete the base sets. Also, the exchange rate to do so is abismal. Exchanging a high rarity card for a fraction of the tokens it requires to to trade just a base ex card is just not good.

 If this was just for the 1 star cards and above, I this would be more acceptable. This implemented trade system makes it near impossible to be F2P (free to play) and heavily favors people who funnel money and have a lot of duplicates of high rarity cards. I have no issue with people you plug money into the game. It‚Äôs their right, but for people who don‚Äôt have that ability it makes it that much harder to comeplete just a base set of the whole set or obtain cards that will let them stand a chance in pvp (player versus player) modes (battling).

However, 1/4 of the game‚Äôs title is ‚Äútrading.‚Äù With real cards, you can trade any card you want to with a card that anyone else wanted to. This game however spits in the face of that. 

With the new Trade Stamina and, more importantly, the Trade Tokens being introduced, the fact that I have to delete at least 4 duplicates of cards that are already hard to come by, just to get ONE card of the same rarity (let‚Äôs not even discuss the math of higher rarities) it‚Äôs completely mind blowing and against the spirit of the game.

US,3,2025-01-29,,changuitoPeruano,Great Game but Flawed Trading,"I love this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Pokemon or card games. However, they lost 2 stars just on the trading implementation. We‚Äôve been eagerly anticipating this feature since the game‚Äôs release, and I personally didn‚Äôt mind the announced restrictions since they seemed to limit people from abusing the trading system.
Now that trading is here, I‚Äôm very disappointed. On top of a refillable hourglass currency, there is a trade token currency that is only obtainable from events or from dusting higher rarity cards. This design punishes new players who would have been greatly encouraged by trading to be able to build solid decks to play and compete with. It also doesn‚Äôt stop players from rerolling new accounts and dusting all the cards they don‚Äôt want so they can trade one or two their main account needs.
Instead of offering a card to trade to a friend, please make it so we can request a card similar to how showcases work. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for this card‚Äù and then friends can make a trade offer requesting a card they would like in exchange. The current system does not work unless you are able to message the player with the card you are wanting, and that has issues with many players not speaking the same language or having to use a third-party app to communicate.

Other changes I would like to see: Dark Mode, dusting cards for pack points instead of trading tokens, being able to view friend‚Äôs whole collection.","Great Game but Flawed TradingI love this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Pokemon or card games.

Besides the usual card art, there are some interactive elements, such as the foil effect, the flairs you can add, and finally the interactive art cards which give you a whole cutscene of behind the frame. I really enjoyed this, although at the time of review the number of these cards was very limited and due to their rarity they were hard to acquire. There are some basic battling systems which is okay for me. I‚Äôm a fan of how this game makes it easier to open free packs and build your collection over the Live version which is very stingy with their free packs. Still, I wish there were more random cpu battles rather than choosing your theme to fight. The game does have some downsides though. Once you‚Äôve spent your 10 minutes a day doing everything, there‚Äôs little else to do. Events are a good addition, but aren‚Äôt much more than another version of what‚Äôs already there. Wonder Pick is frustratingly useless and expensive. The point buy for basic commons and uncommon is way too high for how slow you get them, making it frustratingly difficult to round out your collection.
Update: Trading is needlessly expensive and complicated for no reason. This is looking to be another Nintendo game of infinite hoops to jump through for little benefit.

US,1,2025-01-29,,AngelMisch√Øef,Lacking experience.,"First off it‚Äôs Pok√©mon. Everyone knows it‚Äôs amazing IP with lovable creatures and beautiful art. 

But beyond that there‚Äôs not much good I can say. The game is clear competitor to duel links and I love that‚Äôs what they are going for, but it‚Äôs over simplified. At 20 cards there‚Äôs no room for creative deck building to account for Pok√©mon, items, supporters and tools. The gameplay is shallow with little skill expression. Most of your matches are decided by what you are playing against and winning a coin flip. Going second has a clear advantage. 

Content. There is none. No ranked ladder. No story. No real events. This game has by far the worst events of any mobile game I played. Their idea of an event is login and do a wonder trade, win 5 consecutive games in a row to earn a recolored emblem that serves no purpose. It‚Äôs depressing because 

Cosmetics. It‚Äôs all jpgs. The art is pretty. But it‚Äôs just a flat picture for your battle mat or an icon. Compare that to its competitors like master duel who create entire to arenas to mimic an environment. You know what would be cooler than playing on a jpg of a forest? Actually playing in forest arena. We should also be able to have Pok√©mon as deck pets. I‚Äôve played Dena‚Äôs other game Pok√©mon masters so I know they are capable of making quality and fun stuff. 

Lastly trading. It actually makes me angry that someone okayed this system. It‚Äôs basically the crafting system of every other card game but you can‚Äôt just craft. No no no‚Ä¶ you have to break down cards to get currency to be able to trade. Then to trade you need a friend, and send a trade request. But neither of you have any way to communicate what you want. Making the entire system useless and more expensive than have a normal crafting system. I honestly do not know who this system was designed for. F2P struggle to afford the exchange rates. Paying players are mostly after 2 star cards and 2 star cards can‚Äôt be traded at all. 

Overall it‚Äôs very clear to me this game has been cutting corners at the players expense. It‚Äôs undercooked in its format, gameplay, events, cosmetics and features.

This means that any trade done with stranger in-game friends is basically impossible. Everyone just please don‚Äôt burn your cards for trade tokens it‚Äôs not even worth it for people with every card in the game.",Negative

US,2,2025-01-29,,Jbk108209,The New Trading Update Needs Serious Work,"While I‚Äôve enjoyed my time with TCGP one thing has been teetering this game to being great or predatory and not worth it to play. That was the prospect of trading, and now that it‚Äôs here unfortunately we‚Äôre looking at the predatory route.

Myself and many others don‚Äôt get what DeNA was thinking with the trading system.

The free to play players are rarely going to trade anything outside of 1 or 2 diamond cards since the price of trading is so ridiculous. So then you think ok it‚Äôs for paid players‚Ä¶ but why would the paid players be trading 3 diamond, 4 diamond, or 1 star cards? Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm sure some will but most paid players will have all of them since they‚Äôve opened so many packs going for the 2 star, immersive, and most importantly crown rares to complete the set.

DeNA has seemingly alienated both of their big target markets for what is probably the least likely player in the market being the players who spend very little since they have the cards to spare but also don‚Äôt have everything.

DeNA already had trading down pretty good with just the first line item, same rarity trading. Players wouldn‚Äôt be able to create alternative accounts to farm high rarity cards, and would likely only be saving themselves some time in finding a person to trade the exact card they want for what they have. Adding the 24 hour stamina was a bit much but still workable. The nail in the coffin is the token system. Making the token system use up 3 diamond cards and higher rarity cards is ridiculous. The best way to trade an EX card would be to have at least 7 of the same EX card since you have to get rid of 4 to gain the tokens needed to trade one, then have 3 more of a single EX card to even trade in the first place since you can‚Äôt go below 2 of the same card. You could also use 3 diamond or 1 star cards but they exchange for less tokens so you‚Äôre scrapping even more cards just to obtain 1 you‚Äôre missing.

I hope that my review and other‚Äôs voicing their concern like I‚Äôve seen already will give DeNA the push they need to change this from Pok√©mon Card Game Pocket to Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket, because this feature is just going to sit and rot the way it is and already is seeing many players upset and angry at the game‚Äôs current direction.","The New Trading Update Needs Serious WorkWhile I‚Äôve enjoyed my time with TCGP one thing has been teetering this game to being great or predatory and not worth it to play.

They added trading, which might seem like a good thing, but trading anything of value costs points, which are gained by getting rid of 3diamond cards and up. Generally this would be fine but the amount of points you get vs the amount you need to trade an actually useful card is HUGE, to the point where trading ex‚Äôs will not be worth it for the average player, and the whales won‚Äôt need to do it, who was this even implemented for? The only thing I can imagine it being implemented for is to add another bullet point to the list of features.

Another change made in the new update is an overhaul to how wonder picks work. There used to be a community that would roll until they got a ‚ÄúGod pack‚Äù (a pack with 5/5 ex‚Äôs, full arts, etc) and then add people to let them wonder pick from that, it was honestly great and very helpful! That‚Äôs gone now.

I have played the game since it‚Äôs official release, I bought premium, and I still have yet to get a card above 2* in rarity, no immersives, no crowns, none of that.

That‚Äôs gone now. They changed wonder picks so not only do you have to be friends with the person before they open their pack, but also the ability to even see god packs in your wonder pick seems to have been taken away! I have played the game since it‚Äôs official release, I bought premium, and I still have yet to get a card above 2* in rarity, no immersives, no crowns, none of that. The only way I consistently got cool cards was from the wonder pick sharing method, 7/10 of my 2* rarity cards were got that way, and now it‚Äôs gone. You either get lucky or spend money, those are your ‚Äúchoices‚Äù. Don‚Äôt spend a dime on this anti-consumer game.",Neutral

US,2,2025-01-29,,ajpc22,The trading is awful.,"I won‚Äôt get into what I think is good about this game, because we already know. 

Now, trading prices are completely out of proportion. There is no way burning a 3-star immersive card does NOT give you enough to trade a 1-star card. Absolutely stingy no matter how you look at it. I have to burn FIVE 1-star cards to trade one of them. Absolutely nuts. Those 5 cards I need to burn are the ones I want to keep for trade in the first place, it does not make sense at all. I‚Äôm hugely disappointed on how bad trading is. I think the limitations are fine but it looks like they don‚Äôt want us to trade at all in a TCG.

I expect (and would really appreciate) a revaluation of the trading prices, and also give us daily/weekly/monthly missions so we can farm these trading token without burning our cards. 

I want to end by saying that while this is my opinion, millions of other players think like I do. So I have high hopes that you developers will hear us out and make the game go into the right direction.","The trading is awful.I won‚Äôt get into what I think is good about this game, because we already know.

Unfortunately, the resource costs for trading are prohibitively high, and it feels unrewarding for long-time users. While I understand that trading must have limitations for this game to function, I find it disappointing that it would cost 5+ rare cards simply to have enough of the resource necessary to then TRADE a single card. Additionally, the inability to trade 2 Star cards and above, combined with how little Trade Resource I get for them, really de-incentivizes trading my cards in.

Otherwise, I love this game from top to bottom. Great UI/UX and a fun daily experience.

US,2,2025-01-29,,PopDiggityDog,You have to pay to trade cards,"The interface is incredibly clunky. Every action in the menus you make has an animation that needs to completely play before another action is made. 

You get packs for free which is nice, but only 2 a day. Keep in mind that digital packs have only 5 cards opposed to real packs which have 9 including a guaranteed holographic card. 

Trading, which has just been introduced, requires trading tokens for cards of higher rarity. It also requires mana like every other activity in this game. The ONLY activity that doesn‚Äôt require some form of slowly regenerating mana is PvP.

The PvP is very simple which I don‚Äôt mind, but it does make for extremely repetitive and frankly boring gameplay. Rarely can you ‚Äúoutplay‚Äù someone. Instead the only factors that really matter are luck, and the cards in your deck.

The only thing this game does well is the actual process of opening packs. Earlier I said the menu was clunky, and while I still agree with that statement- your first time playing, you will have a blast opening packs. The pack selection screen, the carousel of all the packs with some having unique qualities (being backwards or having a corner bent), and being able to flip a pack around before opening it, are all very polished and feel good. However, after you have opened a few hundred packs, it‚Äôs no longer fun. Eventually you will find yourself just spamming the bottom right of the screen to skip all the unnecessary steps so you can open the packs.

Not to mention the pack carousel selection bit is all just for show. The cards are generated before you select the pack, it truly has no impact which pack you select. You can prove it by having a friend look at wonder picks before you select the pack and after you‚Äôve picked which set to open.

Overall this game seems to just be another way for Nintendo to make money. Nothing in this game is worth money, and this is coming from someone who has spent thousands on Pokemon cards throughout my life.

Try it out!

US,1,2025-01-29,,Caleb Wilkie,Implementation of trading is unacceptable,"The current iteration of the trading system is frankly broken. Requiring a currency (with a terrible conversion rate), a time gate, and putting tight limitations on the cards that are tradable (no promos or higher rarity cards) is too much. Not allowing cards below 3 Diamond rarity to be converted into currency makes extra duplicates of those cards literally pointless. Additionally only allowing trading between friends and having no in-game trading board is unacceptable. To put all these barriers up and then also add the additional hoops of needing to go to 3rd party forums to find trades makes the mechanic pointless. 

Currently you need to put in a ton of effort just to get ripped off. I won‚Äôt be spending another dime unless this system is improved.","Implementation of trading is unacceptableThe current iteration of the trading system is frankly broken.

US,1,2025-01-29,,Glitchhunter0,Greedy Developers,"Trading is a Complete Ripoff

I was really looking forward to trading, but the way it‚Äôs set up is just awful. Instead of being a fun way to swap cards, it feels like a scam designed to make players waste their collections.

The only way to get trade tokens is by destroying your own cards, and the exchange rates are ridiculous. To get one card of a certain rarity, you have to burn five of the same rarity. Even worse, you can‚Äôt even burn a card unless you already have three copies of it. That means if you want to trade regularly, you‚Äôll have to keep buying packs just to throw cards away.

For casual players or anyone without a massive collection, trading is basically useless. You‚Äôll barely be able to make any trades before running out of cards to burn. There‚Äôs no alternative way to earn tokens, no fair system in place, and no real incentive to even bother with this feature.

Trading should be about player choice and interaction, not a system that forces you to destroy your own cards just to participate. Unless they fix this, it‚Äôs not worth using at all.","Greedy DevelopersTrading is a Complete Ripoff

How do you get this currency? By trashing duplicates of rarity Diamond 3 or higher.

How much currency do you need? Well if you want to trade 1 card of Diamond 3 rarity you would need to trash two duplicates of 1 Star rarity. To be able to trade a 1 star rarity card you would need to trash 5 duplicates of 1 star rarity.

As is, this feature is worthless, and would be better if they never implemented it at all. How do you mess up trading so bad when you have it in the name ‚ÄúTrading card game‚Äù. Greed is the answer.",Negative

US,1,2025-01-27,1.0.9,Jadon2468,"Love the game, but cash grab tactics leave a poor impression from the developers.","*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention * 

I dont know if the developers will actually read this but I hope they will. I absolutely love this game and have played it daily for months. However there are a few greedy tactics used by the developers in order to encourage spending money that I think should be changed or reworked.

The first in irritation and most obvious is the fact that you can‚Äôt open 10 packs with a free pack available. I think this is unnecessarily slimy from the developers side. I don‚Äôt want to always only use my hourglasses or gold when opening 10 packs, especially when I am saving for a new set that is coming out. The game is going to make great money either way, so I feel like its extra to not allow the player to choose what kind of currency is used for opening a pack. (Its currently always the free ones first). 

The second is the limit on hour glass purchases. I understand why this one is somewhat necessary from a bottom line standpoint, although I think its taken to the extreme. You can earn shop tickets through playing the game to use to purchase hourglasses from the shop, but only in a limited amount that gets refreshed monthly. However there is also a limit on the amount of shop tickets you can earn in a day. The fact that the developers felt the need to limit both how many hourglasses you can buy and also how many daily tickets you can earn is ridiculous. Limiting one is understandable, limiting both is cruel and greedy. Every month I purchase all of the hourglasses possible almost as soon it refreshes. But it still takes almost the whole previous months worth of work to earn those shop tickets to be able to buy the hour glasses in the first place. I dont understand the need for a limit on both especially considering how harsh each limit is.

There are more, but this is already quite long and those two are the most glaring. Most of my friends have quit playing this game because of one or both of these tactics. Does the slight amount of extra money gained through these tactics really outweigh the discontent and annoyance felt by the playerbase? I doubt it, and I bet player retention would sky rocket if these were changed.","Love the game, but cash grab tactics leave a poor impression from the developers.*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention *

You get points from opening packs that you can use to buy certain cards. You even get to physically slice open the packs so it feels real. You can exchange duplicates for flare which just makes the cards sparkly or surrounded by particles during battle or stuff. It‚Äôs really fun to show off that you have so many of these super  rare cards that you can afford to trade a few for some sparkly particles. It‚Äôs so fun seeing friends and telling them about your latest pull. It‚Äôs essentially the card game, just perfectly digitalized. There are actually no ads. I‚Äôm not joking, and they‚Äôd better not change that. Not even ads asking you to get premium, which is like $10 a month to open an extra pack and unlock special missions with special awards. But you don‚Äôt have to do it to proceed. They offer the ability to buy things like Pok√© Gold but they don‚Äôt force you, or show any ads telling you to. They are constantly updating it to fix bugs and make it better. You can have friends and I think pretty soon they‚Äôre opening trading, which will make it very interesting.

US,3,2025-01-25,1.0.9,pencil yard,Too confident at flipping heads!,"I downloaded this game with no real expectations, and in my short time playing I have found it to offer three primary modes of engagement:

1. - Card collection.

It&#39;s the most straightforward and solid aspect of PTCGP. Though I don&#39;t have much experience with the &#34;gatcha&#34; genre of mobile game, what I can assert is that the game hardly-if-ever feels stingy, due in part to its &#34;Wonder Pick&#34; system. Still, even with the myriad lights and sounds for every unpacking, I found myself drawn to the game&#39;s next attraction...

2. - Deck building. 

Even with the few workable cards I had starting out, I found myself surprisingly enough enraptured with the strategy behind cobbling together a competitive deck. Identifying the gaps in a build makes it all that much more exciting when you pull a card that patches it up. Even when you get demolished in an online battle, there&#39;s a silver lining in understanding the weakness of your deck that much more intimately. 

Despite the simplistic rules and fairly minuscule selection of cards, I think that the creative potential behind deck building is this game&#39;s best offering. All the more disappointing, then, that the PvP is so lacking.

3. - Battles.

Some of my distaste for how battles play out in this game is simply down to my disdain for how &#34;metas&#34; tend to develop in any card game. I&#39;m not sure how much I can blame the developers for that. What I can blame them for is how deeply they&#39;ve attuned cards to rely on luck in the &#34;Mythical Island&#34; pack. Nearly every meta deck as of now relies on coin flips to either stack energy onto an EX or deal massive damage with an EX. This is, of course, not accidental; The singleplayer battles themed around MI use these exact card combinations. 

But that&#39;s not what I find frustrating, really. It&#39;s that the developers will then hold an event which reward you for consecutive wins! This is a game which is already (though Reddit tends to deny it) baldly luck-based, telling you win 5 matches in a row as if it&#39;s some measure of skill. It&#39;s not‚Äîespecially not months on when the queue is full of level 30-somethings running back-to-back Celebi and Starmie decks. You can buy into the meta, sure, and then pray that you start second every round since that is what is clearly advantageous to every meta deck right now.

It&#39;s a shame, I think the game&#39;s fun but most of the joy of playing is sucked out when a win/loss is decided by literal coin flips. Maybe you can call it a skill issue, i just know it&#39;s unfun.","Too confident at flipping heads!I downloaded this game with no real expectations, and in my short time playing I have found it to offer three primary modes of engagement:

Flipping coins and getting all tails on multiple duels is unrealistic. When we‚Äôre talking about 15+ coins flipped all tails in a row duel after duel. How is this balanced? How is this RNG?

You can flip 10 coins and get no heads while your opponent seemingly always gets the one coin flip needed to win. Not to mention the solo battles are completely rigged the harder the difficulty you set. Wish it were more skill based rather than just letting it be completely luck. Also has no matchmaking abilities, I was going against level 25‚Äôs when I first started the game. Cool if you just wanna collect cards but not worth it if you want to battle.","Luck based garbageCool game minus the battle aspect. Completely luck based combat that seems to always be against you.
