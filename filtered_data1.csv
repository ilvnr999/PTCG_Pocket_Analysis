US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Adrisanros21,Again Pocket is AIDS,"I cannot comprehend how they made a more basic version of TCG but it‚Äôs much worse.
First, the coin is unrealistic there is a greater chance for it to be tails than heads, plus it‚Äôs more probable for it to be double tails than double heads or one head and one tails.
Second, there is no way to go through a players deck, so if you have a crucial card at the bottom of the deck it‚Äôs a sure loss.
Third, the game is all luck based, while TCG is luck base at least in TCG you can make your own luck not like this game.
I can plead all I want but this game won‚Äôt change, so at this point it should only be played to collect cards because if you wanna battle better to play TCG"

However, the game doesn‚Äôt have much to accomplish beyond this as the pvp gets boiled down to who draws their Sabrina and/or Cyrus first to cheese out the easy kills. Think tiered play or limits on typing would be a fun way to spin the battles portion"
US,4,2025-02-23,1.1.2,papawsmurf,Good but,WE NEED MORE DECK SLOTS. You keep adding more cards making more decks viable so WHY are there only 15 slots for decks????
US,5,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Pro gamer5689,Really fun but‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm a really big fan of Pok√©mon games and the anime I even have a big collection of Pok√©mon tcg cards myself but I really think they should make it so the ex cards a bit better because in the real tcg ex Pok√©mon are super duper strong but since this game is like the simplified version of the real game I think you should only make them just a bit better and make so that decks can have more cards but put a limit so that each deck only can have 2 ex cards and also I would like to see some more variety‚Äôs of cards and maybe add an update so that achievements could give you certain card depending on how hard the task is anyways in conclusion it‚Äôs a great game that could use some slight changes.
US,3,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Garchomp‚Ä¶,Trade,This game is a lot of fun but the trading is really stupid because I am able to trade 2 cards with the same rarity but I have 5 different cards with the same rarity and I am not able to trade and I feel like you should just be able to trade whatever you want with no restrictions because if the trade is unfair they you can cancel it.

That‚Äôs not just poor RNG, that‚Äôs horrible.  Game is betting that you lose even if you have a 50% chance at a coin toss, it‚Äôs basically a 2/10 ratio.

The only issues is in certain games, for example, a pok√©mon could get tails and they aren‚Äôt suppose to attack but the attack still happens. The card that makes you pull a random STARTER, pulls a 2nd evolution. And some damage does extra damage just to make the player lose even though it doesn‚Äôt have the advantage AND my pok√©mon is not even in finishing range."

Once again The Pokemon Company International has promoted wealth and cash flow over allowing players to be allowed to play the game. Good Luck. Pok√©mon Company International just lost a life long fan and my kids who were getting into it for life. I know this won‚Äôt affect them or the people that will be dooped into playing this but just a warning. They should be ashamed of what they‚Äôve turned Pok√©mon into."

US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Marc_Tran,Great to trash,"Everything started out great and I even subscribed. But after the recent update, it was as if they rigged it so that you can‚Äôt get any rares without paying more money. I saved up over 4√ó10 pulls plus daily free packs and sub packs, but still have not gotten a single rare (3star+)

Update: After saving up again and doing 2x10 pulls (premium included) and doing daily opens, this is absolutely frustrating. I am canceling my premium now along with everyone else. It‚Äôs clear they rigged this because the drop rates are massively different with this new update. Trading is horrendous as well. Greedy company."

US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,World championnnnn,Trading system is insultingly bad,"the trade system is nothing but a disgrace in this game. it costs 2 different in game currencies + a card of equal rarity. 

1 currency reloads over time. that‚Äôs fine. that‚Äôs enough. you have to limit trades somehow &amp; THAT IS ENOUGH. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE IT SHOULD COST. 

instead, the game forces you to destroy your own collection for the 2nd currency. the game FORCES you to DESTROY your OWN CARDS. just to trade to friends. 

and maybe you think it‚Äôs just the bad cards you have a lot of. NO. ITS ALL YOUR BEST ARTS ONLY. it‚Äôs all your EX cards. that‚Äôs all you can destroy to create the 2nd currency needed to trade. nothing else. 

and maybe destroying 1 really good card gives you enough of that currency to make dozens of trades? NO. THEY HATE YOU. THEY HATE THEIR USERS. 

DESTROYING your BEST CARD will only get you 25% of the currency you need to make 1 SINGULAR TRADE.

Other things more side games or different things. Other than opening packs and battling, that‚Äôs really it. You can build collections for others to see but again the friends aspect is limited.

US,2,2025-02-22,1.1.2,transformer428,Currently meh-unplayable,"Druddigon with rocky helmet. I know it‚Äôs still in the cheese hype phase but hopefully people start talking about it soon. It makes the game so boring. 

Meta decks were one thing, people like to win. Even in casual PvP. But this card completely negates 98% of cards altogether. Completely eliminating diversity and the fun of collecting and building decks. With him and the energy system as is, it‚Äôs either you play meta or meh. I‚Äôve seen people say it‚Äôs more like real TCG but there‚Äôs also a real TCG mobile game for that. The point of pocket was to be a fast paced fun arcade version. But right now it‚Äôs a 5 card game. I get not wanting to change cards. If you‚Äôre sticking to that then simply make a rule about energy. If you‚Äôre using a final stage card then you have to have its energy in the deck. This probably has flaws and I‚Äôm sure you could come up with a better solution but you gotta do something. It‚Äôs play meta or concede. What the fun in that? 

Actually, since you love controlling odds of every detail of the gameplay then just give druddigon a much higher value so he‚Äôs not likely to be drawn on the first turn. Rocky helmet doesn‚Äôt need this. It‚Äôs an item. Not a Pokemon completely unrelated to the deck being used. -40 is just insanity. Especially combo with darkrai and greninja in a dark energy only deck. One of the only counters is to sit there and also build ‚Ä¶ in this ‚Äúfast paced arcade game‚Äù"
US,2,2025-02-22,1.1.2,Nastynateeasy,It‚Äôs alright I guess,Game is fun but pull rate is horrible and unbalanced. Inability to trade higher level cards makes the insane pull rates worse. It‚Äôs possible for someone to spend 20$ in game and literally walk away with nothing of note to show.

Do you understand how much time it took to make these decks only for them to be useless with a new expansion? How is that fair?
US,4,2025-02-22,1.1.2,Tcband,Enhance Mission and Match Rewards!,"I thoroughly enjoy the game, but the current reward structure for versus matches lacks meaningful incentives. Winning should feel more gratifying, with increased rewards and more opportunities to open packs. Likewise, losing shouldn‚Äôt feel entirely punitive‚Äîplayers should still earn XP unless they concede early. Additionally, XP gains should be dynamic, scaling based on match duration and competitiveness; closely contested or longer matches should yield greater rewards. At present, there is little incentive to engage in a full, strategic match versus simply conceding, which diminishes the competitive integrity of the experience."
US,4,2025-02-22,1.1.2,Cmartin411,A little pricey,"Absolutely love the idea of this game. But it is very much pay to win and enjoy. When there isn‚Äôt an event happening you really only earn about two to maybe three packs a day. While this allows for the creation of lower tier decks, obtaining the best cards or the rarer full art cards is very difficult. The full arts don‚Äôt do anything the regular cards do, but seeing giant gaps in the collection every set is really disheartening. I wish there was some way I could trade in the over 80 copies of Bulbasaur I‚Äôve collected and put them towards purchasing any other card. So unless you‚Äôre lucky to pull one of the full art cards you‚Äôre looking for, be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars just for the resources to buy one. Overall the game is great, but there really needs to be a way to cash in the vast amount of lower tier cards you‚Äôre going to obtain. Something like the way other games like Hearthstone do it would make this game perfect in my eyes. Maybe one day something like this will be added."

US,2,2025-02-22,1.1.2,Fixfixfixfixfixfixfixfixfixfi,Fun game but could be better with simple fixes,"This game is undeniably fun and built on a fantastic concept, but several issues hold it back from being a five-star experience.

First, the probability rates for card drops seem highly inaccurate. The game provides a list of odds, but based on my experience, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reliable. There are several basic cards I still don‚Äôt have, yet I keep pulling 18+ copies of the same card that supposedly has the same drop rate. That just doesn‚Äôt add up.

Second, the trading system is frustratingly restrictive. It feels designed to push players toward spending money rather than fostering fair trades. If two players are willing to exchange items of equal value, why impose unnecessary limits? I attempted one trade just to test it out, and after that, I lost all interest especially since low-rarity cards aren‚Äôt even worth the effort.

Third, what‚Äôs the long-term incentive? It would be great to have a way to obtain physical versions of the cards, even if it‚Äôs just a paid option for collectors. They wouldn‚Äôt need to be used in gameplay, but having a tangible collection would add another layer of enjoyment.

For a game that could have been developed by a small team, it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre making an enormous amount of revenue with millions of active players. If they don‚Äôt start making improvements, whether its increasing daily pack limits during events or adding fresh, engaging content, they risk losing their player base.

Oh, and one more thing: why does opening a 10-pack take 120 hours? There‚Äôs zero incentive to choose that option. It should at least be reduced to 100 hours to make it worthwhile.

Do better."
