US,3,2025-01-02,1.0.9,EX Cards,Annoying EX,"This game is fun to pass the time although it does have many drawbacks. Going first is a major detriment. You can not set any energy on your first move if you go first and your opponent may be able to set numerous energies depending on their deck during their first turn, many times leaving you unable to attack until your third turn while they get free shots at you. This is also due to unoriginal deck building since this game rewards those that use the decks that spam EX cards. Trying to build a real deck and getting swept by a Pikachu EX or Celebi deck in 2 turns gets old fast. Dev team needs to allow people who go first to set energy and stop allowing EX cards to be set immediately.","Annoying EXThis game is fun to pass the time although it does have many drawbacks.
