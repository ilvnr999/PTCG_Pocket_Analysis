The game was already completely luck based with about 1% skill involved. Now it‚Äôs gotten 1000% worst than before.

It‚Äôs Pok√©mon! The art is really well done. Battle system is simple to learn. Auto battle feature makes it even easier. Deck building is easy and intuitive. The Pok√©mon themselves are cute, cool and fun to collect. They keep introducing new cards and variations on old ones which keeps the game fresh.
Cons:
Battle system is a bit too simple once you understand it. Going second is an advantage that doesn‚Äôt exist in the original card game. The energy supply system is better in the original card game and more fair. Needs a power balance as Charizard EX is simply too OP, capable of dealing over 200 damage which is more than any Pok√©mon has. Moltres EX can add 1-4 energy every turn meaning you could have Charizard at full charge in 3-4 moves (counting evolutions). It‚Äôs really just poor balancing. I think power creep could be an issue. If you keep increasing power to match charizard, you risk power creep and then anything under 200 hp that deals less than 200 damage will no longer be viable. If you work out a battle system closer to the original card game where there are energy cards and both players have equal opportunity to add them, it could help balance a bit without the power creep being a factor. 
Final take: play the game! Don‚Äôt take it too seriously and just have fun and collect Pok√©mon. It‚Äôs great for what it is and I‚Äôm confident it will continue to be interesting with added card sets and new solo challenges. If you want the nostalgia, you‚Äôll get the nostalgia.

Also going first is a huge disadvantage. I‚Äôve gone first 10+ times in a row. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúrandom‚Äù.

Right now everything is based around Drudigon stalling the game, which means certain decks have no chance attacking, cause the Pokemon will just KO itself. The other way is energy manipulation. Misty, Serperior, Moltres, and Gardevoir. If you‚Äôre not using a deck involving those cards then games are a lot slower for you.

There‚Äôs also 4 cards that basically go into every deck. 2 Pokeballs, and 2 Professor Oaks. So it‚Äôs more a deck of 16 cards, not 20. There‚Äôs a bunch of filler cards that you‚Äôll never see used. Every card should be designed with a potential use over another card, giving you options. Some cards here are just pure garbage to put in packs.

After playing for 3-4 months this is my honest opinion of the state of the game. It has become very stale and boring.","AlgorithmThis game has too many rigged algorithms.

US,2,2025-02-08,1.1.1,mega166,CPU Battles need serious balancing,"CPU battles need a ridiculous amount of balancing. I‚Äôve maybe had a handful of matches that were challenging without cheapness and were won by strategy, as it should be. 

But typically, CPU battles go one of two ways. The most annoying and, for me, prevalent is the CPU gets every possible advantage starting with the coin toss, fills out their bench with Pok√©mon and fully evolves at least half of their Pok√©mon while I‚Äôm stuck with a handful of third stage evolves only drawing the second stage when the battle is a turn from done. Things work out so perfectly it seems like there is zero chance in their card draws, pulling exactly what they need at that given time. And if your deck or their deck has cards dependent on a coin toss, forget it. They get a card like Misty and get heads all the way through. I can count on one hand the number of times a coin flip for my cards went in my favor. You meticulously create a deck for yourself trying to avoid coin toss cards and too many evolves, but even then if the CPU still gains every advantage, why bother?

Sometimes, mainly noticed on the easier battles, you get a clean sweep because the CPU avoids obvious moves, like trading out a nearly defeated Pok√©mon. 

It feels like CPU battles are an afterthought because instead of making it organically challenging and realistic, you either get decimated with no hope of strategy or deck building helping you to succeed or sometimes you get matches where the CPU still gains every advantage and just awkwardly seems to shuffle things around waiting for you to defeat their max evolved Pok√©mon. 

Coin flips should at least give some sort of illusion of there being a 50-50 chance but it‚Äôs more like 1-99. I‚Äôm no mathematical statistics expert, but that kind of seems a bit broken to me.","CPU Battles need serious balancingCPU battles need a ridiculous amount of balancing.

US,2,2025-02-07,1.1.1,HonestThoughtsOnThis,Attention duelists,"First and foremost, there is no trading in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I‚Äôm guessing when it does get added, it will disappoint a lot of people based on how limited the F2P model is. 

Edit: Guess I was right!

This game does a good job of sucking you in at first, but it slows down quickly. 

To be clear, you can slowly build up a collection over time and get most of the cards you want. Your overall luck opening/picking cards will determine what you can battle with while building up your collection, but that luck can vary wildly. 

The game is light on content and has already resorted to repeating its first few ideas. 
It makes me wonder if this game was pushed out early to cover for delays elsewhere in the franchise. They have tons of media they could reference for ideas and they‚Äôve chosen to do only the most basic stuff. 

Battles are a large part of the experience if you aren‚Äôt spending money to open packs. The 20 card 2 copy limit offers its own pros and cons. Because of how limited the card pool is, the competitive aspect of the game is limited as well. Most battles are won based on playing two cards. They‚Äôre the only two cards that draw more cards, and if one person plays more of them, they‚Äôre probably going to win. Luck matters in all card games, but you can really feel it in this one. The game is up front about being casual though, so maybe the high variance is how they hope to achieve that. 

Evolutions require a unique card for each stage. Getting a basic, middle, and final evolution into play in sequence is tough with the limited card pool. Basically, high variance is (almost) everywhere. This will likely get better as more trainer cards and Pok√©mon with abilities come out. 

Even though battling others in PVP is the majority of the content right now, only the winning player gets a reward of 15 exp (not a lot), meaning if you start losing a game or just get a bad opener it‚Äôs reasonable to just concede and try again. There is no penalty for losses. This cheapens the overall experience for both sides. I don‚Äôt think they should add a penalty, but both players should be rewarded for completing a battle.

The F2P economy is a bit stingy. Two packs a day is great as a baseline, but the game doesn‚Äôt reward you much for actually playing. Daily missions give you additional pack every 3-4 days. If you level up you get a free pack. Packs contain five cards. 

Rarity also isn‚Äôt intuitive. Three diamond cards are more rare than most EX cards because EX cards often have alternate arts. This means you have more chances to see Pickachu EX than a Magneton because there are technically three different Pickachu EX cards that could end up in your pack.

Pack Points are the biggest issue for me and why I rate the game so poorly. I would be able to ignore the aggressiveness of the monetization if I was able to craft a few important low-rarity cards I can‚Äôt seem to open. 

I would love a way to convert duplicate cards into cards that I need. Five cards per pack with no guaranteed rares (three diamond of above) means you‚Äôll have gaps in your collection unless you have exceptional luck. The majority of packs you open will just be one and two diamond cards.

I was missing a two diamond card despite opening 40+ of the pack it was in. This means I needed to spend a week of pack points to get one uncommon. Each pack opened gives 5 points and two diamond cards cost 70 points, meaning all your free packs for about a week (2/day is 10 pack points a day). I happened to open my third copy a day later, not a great experience as a F2P. I was saving my pack points to get an EX card for my starving family. 

Here‚Äôs an example of just how stingy they are with rewards. They gave away a few free packs as part of their holiday event. These packs did not give pack points when opened. They won‚Äôt even let players get 15~ free pack points for a yearly holiday event. 

Trading could also fix this, but it isn‚Äôt in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I‚Äôm guessing trading will be very restricted because they stand to lose way too much money if people can complete their collection through trading. My guess is that each account will get some number of free trades and the rest will cost Pok√©gold. I just don‚Äôt see them letting people trade without ‚Äòtaking their cut‚Äô. 

Wonder picks are the other side of the economy and it is just engineered FOMO at its worst. Showing you that you ‚Äòpicked‚Äô incorrectly on failed attempts is definitely a choice when there are videos showing RNG is decided on packs and picks the instant resources are spent. You can and will get lucky, but the pool of cards is already large enough that finding even the right booster pack is a challenge. This is likely meant to be a catch-up mechanic for newer players and an occasional bonus for others. 

The UI needs work as well, it‚Äôs very barebones and not well organized. There are a lot of screens involved in obtaining cards that I wish were skippable. For another example, the best way to give your friends thanks is to go to the community display and scroll to the bottom. Going into the friends list to do the same thing requires 3 taps and some loading for each account manually. Deck building UI/search is also very poorly set up. 

Overall, it‚Äôs the most polished version of Pok√©mon Shop I‚Äôve played, but they really need to fix the reward structure. I think the game has potential, but right now it feels like it‚Äôs an undercooked cash cow first and a game second.","Attention duelistsFirst and foremost, there is no trading in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet.

US,3,2025-02-07,1.1.1,BigKeeks924,So Much More Can Be Done,"I love Pok√©mon and grew up with it which is why I can appreciate a game like this. With that said, this is the most basic attempt at a card game simulation I‚Äôve seen.

It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre completely banking on the nostalgia, and it‚Äôs clearly working. Which is why it‚Äôs likely they will not add any creative mechanics or attempt at fostering a game which incentivizes any form of strategic gameplay or even slight diversity of reward opportunities.

basically if the timer&#39;s minutes are less than half of an hour (30 mins or less), then i shouldn&#39;t have to use another hourglass as if i was reducing the time for another hour. 
i&#39;m not sure if this makes sense or not, but i&#39;m not sure how to explain it.

game currently:
3 hours, 29 mins = 4 hourglasses

my idea:
3 hours 29 mins = 3 hourglasses

I haven‚Äôt spent money and when playing these sort of games I tend to not have the best of luck. You get two free 5 card packs per day, but you can earn tickets to get said packs sooner (up to a certain point per month, which could use this limit to be removed since paying players have more advantages as in more card packs and special rewards in way of unique cards and cosmetics). 

Battling is pretty fun and quick. The animations give a nice touch to the match, giving you more of a sense of satisfaction seeing some moves being played. Timers are in place forcing people to make a move or a move is made for them, usually in the form of passing on their turn, allowing you to keep going and not be stuck with someone that just wants you to concede to win the match.

The one time I reached out to the support for this app, it was slow in responding and not helpful, nor understanding. Their instructions were lacking and missing some steps, enough so I mistakingly got two free premium trials on the same account instead of one on each account. After weeks the reply was that they could not do anything in order to keep the game fair.

The trading system so far in only for paying customers. Example being that in order for me to trade any board besides a common, I have to trade 5 cards of that rarity to the game for tokens to be able to trade a sixth card to my friend. Rarer cards will give back more tokens, but you will always have to give a lot more than you get in return for tokens. Thus unless you pay for packs, you will be able to trade 1 to 4 cards with the free tokens they give at the beginning, then it‚Äôs up to you to give the cards you have to be able to trade. It would have been less greedy and more friendly to free tokens play players if common cards and dust were exchangeable for tokens, example of 20 tokens per card or 20 tokens for 100 dust. But in this state it is really only intended for people that are willing to pay money.

Overall I am a happy with the new content/events that come out to keep you engaged. The gap between pay to play and free players is definitely felt a lot more in the beginning of a release, but over quite a long period of time you can earn good enough cards to be a match for the pay to play players. In essence it is a pay to win mechanic at the release of something, but over months of time you can have decks as complete/powerful as the paying players. If the paid content was purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3. I will update this review as things change in the future.

February 5 2025:

I would like to thank the development team for generous gift of trade tokens I received this morning!! That was an unexpected nice surprise! 

I have kept playing everyday and am enjoying the new live events. The addition of an EX available as a promo prize card is exciting and has a potential of helping towards making the new trade feature more usable for free to play players. If the rate at which EX and rarer cards is highly increased, then it definitely would be another way of tackling the trade token conversion rate problem. 
I have a slight concern in approaching the problem this way, where the overall value of the EX cards would go down due to the increased ease in getting them. Maybe a way to avoid that could be in having a non stop single player event that rewards EX level rarity cards to use specifically for exchanging for trade tokens. 
That could be an innovative way of solving the problem instead of adding trade in token value to common cards and changing the token exchange rates. Not knowing the difficulty in programming these changes in the game, I do not know which would be the cleaner way for the development team to approach this. What I do know is that a change is desperately needed to make this trade feature more realistically available for free to play players. This is not discounting that it is still not easy nor cheap for paying players! At the end of the day though this feature if easier to use for paying players due to the increased amount of cards they receive, thus creating a bigger imbalance between paying and free to play players.
If the bigger difference between paying and free play players is purposely introduced, I would suggest adding battle lobbies for just free to play players, making it more enjoyable for that community having more balanced deck opponents in relation to how many cards can be collected for free play players.

I hope the different suggestions I gave above will be seen and considered to bring back more balance between paying and free play players. Since the update I have used the trade feature to trade common cards with my friends. I haven‚Äôt traded anything requiring tokens in the hopes that someday there will be changes that will allow trading rarer cards cheaper than what is realistically only fairly doable with the tokens given for free as gifts from the developer team.

I will update the review and try to keep it shorter as things change.","A bit greedyPlayed for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun.

You don‚Äôt ‚Äúcollect‚Äù cards in a meaningful way. You pray to the random number generator gods and hope to Arceus you pull something decent. The odds can‚Äôt be that bad though,  right? Right? Well, you tell me. 0.050% chance you open a rare pack. You read that right. To add insult to injury-there‚Äôs no system to exchange duplicate cards for in-game currency, meaning the useless extra copies you‚Äôll pull 99.950% of the time just sit there, mocking you. Meanwhile, in-game currency can be used to unlock cards, but there‚Äôs no direct way to work toward the ones you actually want. It‚Äôs an artificial, exploitative system designed to keep you chasing the next pack instead of building a deck you actually enjoy.

A Trading System That‚Äôs a Total Muk-up

The recent addition of a trading feature should have been a saving grace, but it‚Äôs somehow even worse than expected. Also, don‚Äôt skip past the fact that I stated trading is a recent addition. I hope they released the game as Pokemon CG at first! Anyway, instead of a simple, straightforward way to exchange cards with friends, we get a convoluted mess of ‚ÄúTrade Stamina‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrade Tokens‚Äù because God forbid we just trade cards like a normal human. It feels like the developers actively sat down and asked, How can we make this as tedious and anti consumer as possible? Seems they forgot what the T in TCG stands for. 

Watered-Down Gameplay That Insults TCG Fans

If you were hoping for deep, strategic gameplay like the physical Pokemon TCG or even Pokemon TCG Live, you‚Äôre in for a disappointment. Battles feel shallow, uninspired, and largely automated. There‚Äôs no real room for skill. It just another case of ‚Äútap the screen and hope you win.‚Äù The fact that Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel can faithfully recreate its complex card game while Pokemon delivers something that feels designed for a Slowpoke. It‚Äôs beyond embarrassing.

And it‚Äôs not just about depth. The matchmaking is a complete joke. You will be matched regularly with level 30+ players before you ever see level 10 all while under the Beginner tab. There‚Äôs no balance, no proper ranking system and a whole lot of Unown. Pure chaos. Worse yet, losing a match nets zero rewards. No points, no progress‚Äîjust wasted time.

Repetitive Meta That Kills Any Variety

Even if you suffer through the awful matchmaking and dumbed-down gameplay, you‚Äôll quickly notice that every match feels exactly the same. The same overpowered cards dominate the meta, making deck variety non-existent. If you‚Äôre not running those cards, you‚Äôre at an instant disadvantage. Combine that with the ridiculous card acquisition system, and it‚Äôs clear the game is designed to keep you grinding endlessly or spending money just to remain competitive.

Final Verdict: Stay Far Away

Pokemon TCG Pocket is everything wrong with modern mobile gaming‚Äîpaywalled progression, shallow mechanics, and a deliberately broken economy that treats players like cash cows. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to enjoy the Pokemon TCG, do yourself a favor and play literally anything else.

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight: Pokemon TCG Pocket is an Abomasnow‚Äônation to both Pokemon fans and trading card game enthusiasts. What could have been an exciting, mobile friendly way to enjoy the Pokemon TCG is instead a soulless, money grabbing mess that strips away everything fun about collecting and battling.

US,1,2025-02-05,1.1.0,Casual Yakker,"Highly Irritating, and rigged","Original review below. 

TLDR: this game is a money grab for nostalgic millennials. It‚Äôs too slow, and too biased towards exorbitantly expensive pay-to-play, and the game odds are manipulated. 

Additions: 

Changed to 1 star because the in-game purchases are predatory. If you spend real money to get gold, the gold cost of ‚Äúten packs‚Äù will increase, forcing you to purchase more to try and afford it. Not okay. 

The versus battling has nothing to help casual players. There are 2-3 toxic deck strategies that are used by the majority of players online, making battling extremely un-fun and difficult to progress, which is painful because versus is the only way to consistently gain experience points and progress. 

Trading is completely unusable. The barrier of entry is so high, that the average player can only afford to do a few trades period. 

The booster pack pull rate odds are manipulated. They boost them at random times to get you addicted pull them back to get you to pay for more packs. 

‚Äî-
Let me start out by saying I absolutely adore this game. I will be a player for the foreseeable future.

That said, the reward system needs rebalancing, and the coin flip odds are not 50/50. 

First, many of the rewards you receive can only be exchanged for things that don‚Äôt help you advance in the game. Second, there are many things that do not give you experience that logically should, making it difficult to progress. Third, there are not enough ways to earn pack hourglasses after you reach a certain point in the game. I used to be able to open 5‚Äì6 packs per day, now I can only open the one or two given each day because I have cleared all of the solo battles that give pack hourglasses.

On the coin flip subject, certain cards appear to have different odds. Additionally, the very first coin flip dramatically influences the rest of your results. If you get heads first, you often get mostly heads. If you get tails first, often times you get all tails. Very irritating.","Highly Irritating, and riggedOriginal review below.

The Bad: Boy oh boy this game just wants to bleed your wallet dry. The leveling system is fast at first but eventually will become a slow grind. Especially because of the small exp you earn per battle. Why would anyone want to play a game that requires more work and less reward. The trading system is also very awful! Aside from locking the rarest cards available for trading‚Ä¶ the cost of trading a card is also ridiculous. For example: It costs 500 trade tokens to trade 1 EX card. To earn trade tokens you would need to exchange some cards‚Ä¶ since Commons and Uncommons have no value, you can‚Äôt exchange those for trade tokens, instead you have to exchange your rares and 1 star cards. 1 Star cards can earn you 125 trade tokens. You need 500 to trade one 1-Star cards. You basically need to exchange four 1-star cards to be able to trade for one! Never mind the fact that you also need duplicates to obtain Flairs. The premium pass is also overly priced. For $10 monthly subscription‚Ä¶ you get a premium promo card and about 5 cosmetic items and an extra pack per day. For those wanting to complete their card sets‚Ä¶ this is a burn in your pocket. You are pretty much spending $10 on 1 digital promo card‚Ä¶ while the extra pack can gain you cards you can normally get during regular play and it‚Äôs not even guaranteed you will get super rares. For a ‚Äúgatcha‚Äù game‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not worth it. At least it‚Äôs not worth it for what they are offering right now. If you love pokemon you should just spend that $10 on Pokemon Go in which they actually have events for.","Why I‚Äôm giving this a very generous 3-Star‚Ä¶The Good: This game is quick and fun.

Small spenders and free to play players might not even have that many copies laying around and doing nothing and on top of it, you cannot even trade for the newest cards which are the cards that the small spenders and free to players might actually want to trade for. After the terrible trade system was added, the game added in the newest set, Space Time Smackdown, and the newest set destroyed the entire balance of the meta. No longer does the game have a varied meta with tons of different decks to play, it is play darkrai ex and its many deck variants or don‚Äôt bother playing the game at all. Darkrai ex completely destroyed any balance of the game with its insane early game pressure that makes playing any deck not named darkrai almost impossible to play. The way that the devs designed the newest set tells you everything you need to know how the direction of the game is going to move forward, pay a ton of money to get the newest strong card or don‚Äôt bother playing the game at all as the newest strong card destroy the old meta completely and make all battles against it be completely miserable if you are not running the card itself.",Negative

Dailies: we need more daily activities to entice us to open the app beyond just a free pull or two. How about a new challenge every day with a pull as the reward?

It could be a goal in battles or a deck that somebody at HQ put together that we have to beat. It would take you guys three seconds to make a competitive deck that people could view as a challenge.

Rewards for online play: 15 XP is a ridiculous reward for beating someone that could range from completely incompetent to incredibly good at the game. 

How about we add skill based matchmaking? Better players are rewarded more? 

Better trading system: the current trading system is asinine and easily the worst part of the game as it currently stands.

US,1,2025-02-03,1.1.0,Jadon2468,"Love the game, but the cash grab tactics are just sad","*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention * 

I dont know if the developers will actually read this but I hope they will. I absolutely love this game and have played it daily for months. However there are a few greedy tactics used by the developers in order to encourage spending money that I think should be changed or reworked.

The first in irritation and most obvious is the fact that you can‚Äôt open 10 packs with a free pack available. I think this is unnecessarily slimy from the developers side. I don‚Äôt want to always only use my hourglasses or gold when opening 10 packs, especially when I am saving for a new set that is coming out. The game is going to make great money either way, so I feel like its extra to not allow the player to choose what kind of currency is used for opening a pack. (Its currently always the free ones first). 

The second is the limit on hour glass purchases. I understand why this one is somewhat necessary from a bottom line standpoint, although I think its taken to the extreme. You can earn shop tickets through playing the game to use to purchase hourglasses from the shop, but only in a limited amount that gets refreshed monthly. However there is also a limit on the amount of shop tickets you can earn in a day. The fact that the developers felt the need to limit both how many hourglasses you can buy and also how many daily tickets you can earn is ridiculous. Limiting one is understandable, limiting both is cruel and greedy. Every month I purchase all of the hourglasses possible almost as soon it refreshes. But it still takes almost the whole previous months worth of work to earn those shop tickets to be able to buy the hour glasses in the first place. I dont understand the need for a limit on both especially considering how harsh each limit is.

There are more, but this is already quite long and those two are the most glaring. Most of my friends have quit playing this game because of one or both of these tactics. Does the slight amount of extra money gained through these tactics really outweigh the discontent and annoyance felt by the playerbase? I doubt it, and I bet player retention would sky rocket if these were changed.","Love the game, but the cash grab tactics are just sad*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention *

As it is, it becomes very repetitive and boring quickly. I gave it a much longer try then other games due to the brand power of Pok√©mon, however, without trading all you can do is open 2 packs a day of the same duplicate cards. There‚Äôs no way to get new cards or the cards you need to complete sets without just randomly opening 2 packs a day. It‚Äôs a great model but when you realize they aren‚Äôt opening up trading and the only other way is to spend money on gold. Until there are more goals to complete to let you open packs or get the cards you specifically need, it just looks like a boring money grab after a day or 2.

Edit: trading is such a mess up, I‚Äôm almost in shock. I thought with the addition of trading my review would change to more positivity. The system for trading is without a doubt the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. The whole point of being able to trade is to complete your collection but it‚Äôs just another lottery system that encourages irresponsible spending habits. I understand the goal of an app is to make money, however for a company such as Pok√©mon(who is not hurting in any way) to encourage such poor habits through underhanded tactics is outright shameful.","Not completeThis game was initially great and ide honestly give it a much better rating if it were a complete game.

US,3,2025-02-01,1.1.0,tonio6000,A bit greedy,"Played for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun. I haven‚Äôt spent money and when playing these sort of games I tend to not have the best of luck. You get two free 5 card packs per day, but you can earn tickets to get said packs sooner (up to a certain point per month, which could use this limit to be removed since paying players have more advantages as in more card packs and special rewards in way of unique cards and cosmetics). 

Battling is pretty fun and quick. The animations give a nice touch to the match, giving you more of a sense of satisfaction seeing some moves being played. Timers are in place forcing people to make a move or a move is made for them, usually in the form of passing on their turn, allowing you to keep going and not be stuck with someone that just wants you to concede to win the match.

The one time I reached out to the support for this app, it was slow in responding and not helpful, nor understanding. Their instructions were lacking and missing some steps, enough so I mistakingly got two free premium trials on the same account instead of one on each account. After weeks the reply was that they could not do anything in order to keep the game fair.

The trading system so far in only for paying customers. Example being that in order for me to trade any board besides a common, I have to trade 5 cards of that rarity to the game for tokens to be able to trade a sixth card to my friend. Rarer cards will give back more tokens, but you will always have to give a lot more than you get in return for tokens. Thus unless you pay for packs, you will be able to trade 1 to 4 cards with the free tokens they give at the beginning, then it‚Äôs up to you to give the cards you have to be able to trade. It would have been less greedy and more friendly to free tokens play players if common cards and dust were exchangeable for tokens, example of 20 tokens per card or 20 tokens for 100 dust. But in this state it is really only intended for people that are willing to pay money.

Overall I am a happy with the new content/events that come out to keep you engaged. The gap between pay to play and free players is definitely felt a lot more in the beginning of a release, but over quite a long period of time you can earn good enough cards to be a match for the pay to play players. In essence it is a pay to win mechanic at the release of something, but over months of time you can have decks as complete/powerful as the paying players. If the paid content for purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3. I will update this review as things change in the future.","A bit greedyPlayed for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun.

However, mirroring other reviews, slow players are incredibly irritating. You might be winning so the other person will seemingly stop playing and will only make a move right before their timer is about to run out, probably in the hopes that you will just give up and concede. Very annoying. Additionally, the new trade feature isn&#39;t great because you pick a card you are willing to trade and send it to a friend and MAYBE they will offer a card you don&#39;t own, but usually not. I would much rather be able to show what I am looking for, or at least for there to be prompts letting me know if the card I picked is a card that friend does not own. I haven&#39;t been using the feature due to this. For example, I have most of the Genetic Apex pack filled out, but never pulled a Gardevoir card. It would be nice if I could just say that that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for on my trade profile.
