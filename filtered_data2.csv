US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Lilyifei,Best mobile game ever!,"This game is great if you wanna open packs for free, and you get to build decks and enter tournaments and completions!"
US,4,2025-01-12,1.0.9,QueenCelebi,The Booster Packs,"This game is actually very addictive, mostly when you’ve just started playing it because you get the opportunity to build up your cards and the element of surprise is there. I enjoy the random battle gameplay very much, there’s never a long wait time to battle someone online. The battles are fun but also strategic - makes you think carefully about how you play The Pokémon cards and use their attacks. It’s a good mental game also I’d say.
My cons? I think it takes a while for them to update the game in terms of online events and challenges and at a point you find yourself playing the game less than usual. I guess if you were to look at it from a different angle, I guess the game gives you time to touch grass also than playing constantly. lol. My greatest problem with the game really are the booster packs. I find them to be very repetitive. Like why do I have 15 Raticate cards??It’s very rare to actually select a good booster back, you mostly just get cards you already have which can be annoying. It’s also very slow building booster packs for 10 packs opening which can be dreading. 
All in all, I actually do love the game, just would like some more updates."
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Sylas Colvin,I love this,"This game is so addicting and makes me want to live in it, Keep up the good work"
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Tomato kingg,Fun is fun,I like this game
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Miller252r,I love this game,This is one of the only games I really play and I like. If you like gambling and pokemon and u don&#39;t like spending money get this.
US,2,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Durango28465,Stupid game,"The game was fun                            for 2 seconds it takes 7 hours to level up so you can fight also the stupid rules in the battle are the dumbest things I ever saw what is the point of having rare cards if you can’t even use them it says only basic cards can be used so much information wasted to scream at a game the custom decks are 23% stupid because the energy things you can only have 3 the heck is wrong with this game I literally busted my skin cuz I was so angry, anyone who says I am wrong I’m suing you."
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,GJ1267,Favorite game,This is my favorite game but I’m really waiting for trading to come out
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Ajlg12,Just one thing,"So I’ve been a Pokefan since 1997 when I first started playing at the age of 6. I’ve been a huge fan of the whole franchise!! The one thing I’ve always been a fan of is trading….. with that being said the game says trading will be featured on a future update…. Any idea when that will be? This really isn’t just a review but a question lol so here’s the review… I would give it a thousand stars if I could, I’ve always wanted a game where the card game is the main thing and I do not know anybody around my area I live in that knows the card game so this was very exciting to see come into play! 5/5 on everything about this game so far!!!!! So this is the end of the review.. I have to go so for I “gotta catch’em all” :)   ;)"
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,567foxygarchomp,Hello people. Don’t get angry at me for saying this.,"So the coin flip, people say it’s rigged but I disagree (sometimes). I had 4 coins to flip and 3 of them were heads (that’s unrealistic in life). I think the game was really well made. Not pay to win at all. The illustrations are beautiful! And the packs…welll….the mew pack gives me good things. I got a jump into art celibi from that. But…the other packs just give me rattatata straight. I get so ticked when I get 4 rattatata from one normal pack and then a Pidgey. But then I get TWO garadoseEX from one mew pack. What? So be aware the normal packs can be a little rigged. I’m happy that they improved the pay thing. It’s not pay to win, no pay needed. If you play POKÉMON UNITE and play This then you can see the difference."
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Ampliphy,I found a bug and they’re refusing to acknowledge it,"I found a problem where the game won’t display certain cards when they are owned. Resulting in players running in circles trying to get cards they think they need, that they in fact already have."
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Mr.Droptables,This is a joke right?,Why do you not het starter decks? Am i really supposed to wait 12+ hours to even look at the battle menu? Really?
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Unmanned_07,Why no garchomp?,We need garchomp
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,I it g,Badly,It was so bad I had to download it
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Autumn Dawn Beltre,Beginners review,Great app. Very engaging!
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,maladii,"Janky, feels worse than most Indie games","I don’t know what it is about the Pokémon franchise, but you need a serious tech update. It’s not like y’all don’t have any money, but it always feels that way. 

I guess it could be cultural, I’ve heard that Japan has a problem with always capitulating to seniors in a corporation, and it does feel like this game was implemented by people who peaked 30 years ago. 

Bad, outdated UX conventions, tons of time-wasting and boring screens, boring or noisy UI design, and extremely sub-par development implementation. I haven’t played a game that felt so janky for a long time and Pokémon isn’t a no-name brand. 

It’s pretty fun, but the app is aesthetically unpleasant in almost every way. If I want to play Pokémon in an ugly ill-equipped place I’ll go to the local game store."
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Lukasw34,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,It’s pay to win trash. Absolute garbage of a game. Do not let the rating fool you. It is GARBAGE.
US,2,2025-01-12,1.0.9,AndYoureDunn,Battles are too simple,"The general concept is fun but the battling is (like the main series game) is way too simplistic, leading to incredibly frustrating situations in which the outcome of the battle is essentially decided before any actual action happens. If you start first, you’re already fighting at a massive disadvantage."
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,moe.reviews,Mayen obot edukere,Super Amazing
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Nowert,Such a great game needs more packs a day though,I just got this game. I love it. The poll rates are good. It’s really fun. I just wish there was more packs. You could open every day and make there a way to earn pokey gold instead of buying it still great!
US,4,2025-01-12,1.0.9,boss pug 0678,good game,"i personally really like this game, everyone saying it’s impossible to play the game free to play is just straight wrong. i have not spent a cent on this game and i have 2 celebi illustrations, a celebi full art, and plenty of other full arts and exs. i think it is a pretty great game. it is entirely possible to play this game free. u have another friend who plays and he has illustration cards and even a crown mew and he too has spent nothing on the game. anyone mad just expects everything to be handed to them. only reason i did not give it 5 stars is that i’m annoyed it’s limited to 2 packs a day without a good source of hourglasses."
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Jaymonkey6183,Good game,Good game
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,ChinoTCG,Battles are trash,"I love the collecting aspect of the app don’t get me wrong, but the the battles are just way toooo rng based. I swear my opponents rarely ever gets tails and it’s very frustrating."
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,FucccccccClashRoyale,No chance,No way the coin toss odds are 50-50. I will play like 5 games in a row and never get an ideal coin toss. Makes the game so frustrating to watch a Celebi player get 12 heads and hit me for 600 but I can’t even one head just once to do an extra 40 damage.
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Justin55685,Not worth battling,"Nice cards detail. Overall the battling aspect of this game is absolutely trash. Mewto is way too over used most matches are just people using mew. Also why be able to have friends if you cannot 1 rematch them 2talk/ emote or anything or anything at all. might as well take it out the game and then just add that whole feature into the game in a future update makes no sense at all. 

Being said that the battling aspect of this game is the main issue what else is there to do? Once you collect your one pack in the morning last pack at night and if ur lucky get a third pack mid day. That’s pretty much your left with collecting 3 to 2 packs a day and if you’re already gassed out by trying to battle with new unique decks 85% of people are spamming Mew,pikachu and , articuno misty . All 3 turn game winning decks. SOOOO BORINGGGGGGGGGGG."
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,G free sd,One problem,After installing it I found the problem the authentication process failed please help
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,SkyerTian,No guaranteed reward system and too high variance between players,"I want to leave a negative review for this game because even with full participation in the events, you still may not obtain certain event cards. The variance between players is too high. Game developers shouldn’t treat players this way; there should be a guaranteed reward system. Instead of making players feel disappointed time and time again, which eventually leads to resentment toward the game."
US,2,2025-01-12,1.0.9,SXrUFFY9O3,Already a pay to win Meta this Meta that game☠️,"I see this title having potential but if you’re seeing this DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IN LIFE ON PVP, think, you could be very literally doing anything that actually makes you happy. Not pvp tho, Celebi spammers and Articuno EX and Vaporeon duos are flooded. Doesn’t even matter if you even have any fire types I got whooped by a guy with 2 EX Celebi’s"
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Acscott6,"Great game, but play flaws","I enjoy the Pokémon TCG very much and will continue playing it! However, there are some points of contention when playing: 

1. When an opponent concedes, there is no penalty. It discourages me from playing Online matches.
SOLUTION: Devs should show opponent’s quit rate to players

2. The game needs more avenues for discarding duplicate cards:

SOLUTIONS:
a. Exchange duplicates &gt; Shop Tokens: 3 dupes for 50 dust, or equivalent for rarity ( EX cards&gt; Black shop token)
b. Exchange &gt; Card packs
c. Exchange &gt; Wonder Picks

3. Allow players to Create Decks from the “Solo/Versus”. Battle pages"
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,nicole..ravenclawxX,Where my cute cards at boi,I was opening and where my cute card at boi I have a ratatouille and I don’t want it Thanks!
US,4,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Fun game 152,Good but not great,I really like this game. The one problem is add a scanning feature where you can scan your actual Pokémon cards that would be really cool.
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Marcobee1,I LOVE GAMBLING,This game got me into gambling and I have NEVER BEEN MORE HAPPY IN MY H-ING LIFE YO
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,ren553,Random flips isn’t so random,It’s bad whenever I get an initial tails flip it automatically flips all the rest to tails. I thought it was just bad luck this happened over and over knowing this amount this happens is more like a coding error and honestly doesn’t make want to play as much since one flip decides the whole game each time which is horrible. Out the 20 times I played I got 9 times all tails from ranging 3-6 coins that is not random. I started to take tally because they was so recurring a lot of other games have pseudo random codes in their game but this doesn’t. So hence why bad coding.
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,fhostface_ninja,What is this?,Change it to get trails instead or just teach us how to get heads. It’s a 2D coin.
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Will21221,5 stars,This game is exciting and has a similar feel to opening packs in real life. I love it because you don’t need to spend money on this game.
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,PumpkinBear420,It’s a great idea however…,"The new Celebi EX is a lil too over powered, especially once combined with the Serperior cards, and the trading card section which I’m my option is one of the coolest parts of this idea, is still unfortunately undergoing it seems, so if that could be added soon I think people would like that a lot, and correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t there more metal/dark/and psychic cards in real life vs the game?"
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Ryanliker,RNG and Difficulty,"Giving the AI better RNG deck pulls does not
make the game harder, it
just screws the player. If I draw random, they draw random, that’s kind of the whole point of random draws."
US,1,2025-01-12,1.0.9,HotLikeSavce,Fun if it weren’t rigged.,You’ll start to realize that 75% of the coin tosses in game go against you. It’s like clockwork. No point in using misty card in the water deck. Just had 10 tosses got 1 heads.
US,5,2025-01-12,1.0.9,lacrosee,Lucas o,There are a lot of good cards that you can pull but you can’t just open a pack you have to wait 12 hours to open a pack.but I pulled a charizard card!
US,3,2025-01-12,1.0.9,ashecaughtem,"Fine Base, But Needs Work","This seems like the kinda app that’s really fun for like maybe a month and then gets boring.  Each pack only has 5 cards and they don’t even have a guaranteed rare or anything like that, so eventually you get the the point where you’re bored of the 1-2 competitive decks you can play with, and it’s been weeks since you’ve opened a playable card that you don’t have yet (or a card that you don’t have yet, period)

You can get 1 of the in game store currency per battle for 5 battles, then nothing, so there isn’t even an in game incentive to keep playing. I’ve reached the point where the only reason I still have this on my phone is because it’s pretty new and they could make it more playable, but compared to similar games like mtg arena, I just don’t see myself sticking around unless they make playing feel more worthwhile."
US,2,2025-01-12,1.0.9,Johaust Stonewood,All Good Things Must Come to an End,"The game is addicting and fun. It’s very easy to invest money into it, here and there, to grab every card; however, at some point, the game prevents you from getting new cards, and even winning battles, to make you want to play more. For me, it’s the opposite. I spent a lot of money to get all the cards, to no avail. You’ll get lucky, time and time again, but eventually, it’s rigged against you. It’s a fun one, and the cards are cool and even nostalgic; however, it’s a broken system that should reward long term players, especially those that spend a lot of money."
US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,tomorrow morning at six,Love,I love this game so much
US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,Facts say yes,Pog,Pog
US,3,2025-01-11,1.0.9,dllolllb,Quite enjoyable,"No ads. No pay to win. The battles work well. Even got to play with irl friends, although I like playing the AI. The structure allows me to play at the difficulty I prefer and challenge myself at my own pace.

Update as of January:  I’ve been playing it since release at end of October. I’m not playing it much anymore as of this week. This is because there is only one division battle in. There needs to be a featherweight and a heavyweight division. Only allowing non EX Pokémon in the featherweight. The thing is that all we ever see in battles anymore are the same optimal set ups of decks.  It is boring. It makes it so that you yourself can not use your favorite Pokémon. You have no choice but to use the same optimal setups that everyone else is using. I want to enjoy some fights using the lower tier Pokémon and a variety of Pokémon.  I really liked it the first few weeks. Oh well."
US,4,2025-01-11,1.0.9,21Bdawg,Great game but….,Extremely fun and addictive to play. My main gripe is why do I have to go through so many screens to claim my rewards each day that alone is time consuming. Just like in Pokémon unite.
US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,Coolguy1241,This game is fun,I said what I said
US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,Nj12345cvq,Amazing,This game is super fun and easy to play. It’s easy to learn and fun aswell it assists you a lot and you will always have a good time! I got 114 cards in the first hour!
US,1,2025-01-11,1.0.9,h3llboy_,Meta cards and decks ruin the fun,"Would be a 5/5 star game but the multiplayer is so unbelievably frustrating. You are forced to use a meta deck and can’t really have fun with other decks because everyone is using the few meta decks that are. practically unbeatable unless you are running direct counters. Mad disappointing, need more than just a 3 point system and more cards that make other non meta cards more playable. Card collecting is fun just needs more packs and trading."
US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,12345 >:D,Battling,Battling requires zero skill and is all luck based. Would love if I could stop going first against rival decks. It’s infuriating to see my opponent get every single card they need flawlessly while I struggle to even get anything set up. RNG is strong in this game and it’s either with you or against you. Hope there’s some changes made to the battling
US,3,2025-01-11,1.0.9,Jimmy ok gg,Fix this,Good game but when in the card game (which I know how to play) when you go first you attack first but in this when it says your first basically nothing changes. Please fix this. But yea good game almost the same as real life Pokemon cards.

US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,ABC DEFGHIHIHIHI,Pokemon TCGP  will enrich your child’s world view,"This is not just Pokémon TCG Pocket. This is Pokémon TCG experience. This game has so many agile infertile descriptive words and fluent Pokémon that sometimes I just reach out to Charmander and say give me a big kiss.
I always love this game for how compassionate and how much of appeasing grace it was on my phone. I couldn’t believe the ads that I got but for the 201 I finally said screw it and decided to download the game. Instantly my life has changed forever, and I can only thank Mr. Yamato for making Pokémon on the Nintendo switch by the way Skibidi Toilet Well that’s all my sigma soldiers."
US,1,2025-01-11,1.0.9,1nonlyPanda,Why is this so highly rated?,"I’ve played this game for the last few months now, I have 1,600 cards and most of both decks completed. For a multi-trillion dollar company they can’t even make a mobile card game right the fact that there are only like 500 cards in the game and I’ve pulled over 1k without getting all of the normal cards with no crazy art on them is just ridiculous. You will reach a wall in this game where there is no point in even collecting because no matter how many you collect there is nothing to do with the extras and and you won’t ever get all the cards. Also the battles aren’t fun because there are no card varieties yet everyone is running the same decks of cards and if they get 1 sign of losing the game they concede and then you do it over again. I’m not wanting to dog in this crappy game, I truly wish it was good but I can’t find fun in it. I’d rather them have made this game a nft game at least then maybe I could have made money off my time wasted pulling packs for the last few months."
US,2,2025-01-11,1.0.9,CokeJeebz,Imbalanced cash grab,"Game is poorly balanced, and card acquisition system slowly funnels you towards spending money. Initially the game gives you lots of packs to open, but this slows down quickly. Packs are about $1 each, and drop rates are so abysmal you could easily open 100 packs without seeing anything interesting."
US,5,2025-01-11,1.0.9,Nixadon,Try For Free,"Free-to-play community is currently thriving.

Bad strategies can be a definitive loss.
Luck can beat perfectly-executed strategy.
Pay-to-win helps. 
Players can stall.
