They also require you to use gold on a lot of things for no reason which in store makes it so you can‚Äôt stock up on the currency that costs actually money and you can get actually get good rewards for. The trade system that they roof over 2 months to actually put into the game is also god awful and makes 0 sense. Please do better.

US,2,2025-03-10,1.1.2,JordyForty,Great Concept Mediocre Execution,"The release of this game has been surprising, considering that this is the last thing I thought Pok√©mon would release. I love the concept of the game where you open packs every day and make decks to play against people online but there are some problems with the actual execution of the concept. First, the game just feels empty. I log on, play a game collect my daily rewards then I realize that there is nothing to really do or no reason to actually play the game. For example the  &#34;event&#34; mode gives you only an emblem and a couple of quests that give you barely any rewards. And other than that the only reason to play would be to get xp, but it&#39;s not even worth it because you only get 15 xp per match and one pack when you level up. This game would be 5 stars if they incentivized playing the game with rewards and packs that can be earned by winning. Other mobile games all have events that grant rewards and create fun for a live service game. I feel like this game spent all of its time on the card collecting aspect but forgets about battling and playing the actual game.","Great Concept Mediocre ExecutionThe release of this game has been surprising, considering that this is the last thing I thought Pok√©mon would release.

US,3,2025-03-10,1.1.2,zae.de,"Good, but has potential to be better.","This is my honest review of Pok√©mon TCG Pocket as someone who has played multiple trading card games over the years. I feel like there are a few things that could be improved over time with this game to make it better and more enjoyable to play for longer periods. 

Firstly, this game is very simple compared to other card games on the App Store, and it almost takes away from the gameplay because some of the battles are very predictable. There has been multiple times where I‚Äôve entered a match with someone and it‚Äôs clear by maybe one or two turns who is going to win, for the most part. Especially when certain Pok√©mon are used that have effects that you can‚Äôt defend against or negate, unless you have certain cards that have effects that do. I feel as though this can be improved by continuing to ‚Äòretrain‚Äô cards and produce them with effects attached, such as the new Pok√©mon variants released Triumphant Light release (such as Steel-Type Magnezone, Golbat, etc.)

Also, I feel like the odds of pulling certain cards is really low. I‚Äôm not expecting to pull an EX Pok√©mon or anything, but I would appreciate it if the odds were at least increased for more evolution monsters that could help newer players develop quicker, such as increasing pull chances of non-EX variants of Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, etc. 

I feel as though there is also an issue with the coin flip system, other trading card games have had greater success with automating all coin flips to make the game quicker and smoother. I don‚Äôt feel it is too difficult for a game company like Game Freak to create an automated coin flip system for this game, as there is always a perfect balance of a 50% chance so it can‚Äôt be changed to favor any one player. 

And finally, I think there should be some sort of change to the reward system in regards to a player quitting a match before it ends within a certain time limit. I can‚Äôt even count how many times people have quit just because they‚Äôre about to lose, or don‚Äôt have a winning first hand. I feel as though the reward system isn‚Äôt rewarding enough to the winning player, because all that is gained from battles is XP. I‚Äôm not asking to receive a bountiful reward or anything, but maybe x1 Random Hourglass per win (Wonder Pick or Booster Pack) would be rewarding enough for me as a player to be encouraged to keep playing, because it would encourage me to play more battles to get more Hourglasses. 

I know Game Freak probably won‚Äôt see this comment. But if you do, I appreciate you taking the time to read it, and I hope some of the key points I mentioned are important or convincing enough to implement in some form in the future.

As other reviews state you can dump as much money and time into this game but some level 10 who‚Äôs gotten extremely lucky comes into battles, pulls all their top cards such as type specific supporters and EX cards, and what‚Äôs most annoying to me is them landing eight tokens off a misty card when I can‚Äôt seem to get one in half a dozen games. This becomes extremely annoying when you have almost all of what is considered the best decks and you can‚Äôt get five consecutive wins due to ‚ÄúLuck‚Äù.

US,3,2025-03-07,1.1.2,Turtlefriend997,I guess I‚Äôll give it a 3-star.,"Overall, this game is fun and free-to-play, but like other Pok√©mon games I‚Äôve played, it‚Äôs not perfect. Here‚Äôs the reasons why:

1. Hourglass obtainment methods. Although the game doesn‚Äôt cost money to download and play, I feel it‚Äôs more biased toward greed. It‚Äôs obvious the developers of the game want you to spend money on gold to open ten packs so you can get better cards, because there are no methods aside from solo battling (which gets boring fast) to gain hourglasses (currency used to speed up stamina recovery time). If they didn‚Äôt want you to spend money on gold, there would be more methods to obtain these hourglasses. You can buy hourglasses from the game‚Äôs store with another currency (shop tickets), but, in addition to the predatory pay-to-play methods I‚Äôm starting to see more and more often, after you‚Äôve bought as many hourglasses as the game will let you per month, you will have to wait another month for them to refresh, making it increasingly harder to buy ten packs without having to spend any real money. 

2. Battles. It‚Äôs obvious the game is biased towards the AI that they match you against in Solo Battling, because using my Celebi deck I will flip 8/10 tails when all I needed was another head. Then, against my AI opponent‚Äôs Kanghaskan, it will flip 3/3 heads which was all it needed to KO my Celebi. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you were about to win. 
In addition, I‚Äôve flipped over 20 coins in one match before and got 20/20 tails, while others I‚Äôm against will get 20/20 heads which was what they needed to KO my EX cards. 
Also, I‚Äôm level 23, but not a very good battler. I‚Äôve been going on Beginner mode continuously, but keep getting matched against level 40+ players who‚Äôve spend loads of money so they can get all the good cards before me. 

3. Pack rarities. As the game has progressed, it‚Äôs become increasingly difficult to pull good cards like golds and jump-into-arts because of the low pull rates for them. In the most recent pack expansion, Triumphant Light, I‚Äôve opened 30+ packs and only just claimed my Leafeon EX while my friend, who hardly ever plays, pulled it on the very first pack he opened. This is frustrating since I‚Äôve poured many hours of playtime into this game. It can also be hard not to feel jealous of my friend‚Äôs incredible luck, especially since Leafeon and Glaceon are my favorite Pok√©mon. 

4. Trading. It can be difficult to get points so you can trade higher rarities to your friends, but that‚Äôs my only complaint about it. I think there should be more methods to obtain Trading points so trading can be made easier. 

5. Making friends. I love to make new friends so I can trade with them and obtain higher-rarity cards faster, but one of the only ways you can make friends is through Wonder Picks. I think the ‚Äòmaking friends method‚Äô should be changed so we don‚Äôt have to type in a Friend Code, we should simply be able to search up usernames and make friends that way like in other Pok√©mon games. 

Sure, there are good things in this game, like building your own decks and showcases, but the game is mostly lackluster when it comes to battling, trading, obtaining rare cards, and getting currencies, which is over half of what the game is about. Premium is not worth it for the high price and bad pulls. Impossible to open 10 packs if you don‚Äôt spend money. Would recommend as a good time-killer, but don‚Äôt expect to pull any good cards like golds because of the developers and the terrible UI.","I guess I‚Äôll give it a 3-star.Overall, this game is fun and free-to-play, but like other Pok√©mon games I‚Äôve played, it‚Äôs not perfect.

The pack opening mechanisms are supposedly random, however, those who spend money are more likely to receive better cards regardless of probability of obtaining these cards. Secondly, whenever you battle, the probability of you getting screwed over by random probability is extremely high. For instance, I have a celebi ex card that is supposed to do 50 damage each time it lands on heads - the coin is flipped for however many energies are attached. I had six energies attached and each coin was tails. To put that into perspective, there is basically a 1% chance of that occurring.

US,3,2025-03-05,1.1.2,Mach12341234,"Great, but‚Ä¶","Listen, the game itself is super polished, well thought out and is what you would expect from the Pokemon universe. Being a 90‚Äôs child and growing up with Pokemon blue and red on game boy‚Ä¶ and obviously being obsessed with the trading cards back then, this feels like the 2 worlds came together to make something special. 

The packs feel fair, even before I paid for the gold membership. I was pulling rare cards and building decks for each Pokemon type. 

However, when it comes to battling (not the AI, real opponents) this thing feels absolutely horrendous at times. I have gone on 10 game loss streaks because of a card my opponent has that can do 80 damage with 1 energy. Or can flip for 50 damage per energy stack with 5+ energy stacks. 

The meta just feels super off balanced unless you choose to play with what I would consider to be cheap tactics with newer cards that don‚Äôt allow your opponent to even attempt to challenge you. And because battling is 80% of the reason you play this game, I find myself opening the app less and less, because I don‚Äôt want to play with the dark or grass class, which pretty much rule the segment. This also hinders the replay value ‚Äî as everything becomes super predictable. 

I hope the meta is reevaluated at some point and balanced to allow all deck types to have a fair chance of being able to win battles. 

Download the game. You will have fun at first.

US,1,2025-03-04,1.1.2,Dylan Bokor,Do not play this,"While it should seem obvious that this game requires a lot of money to play any good decks, Pocket has *by far* the most anti-consumer approach I‚Äôve seen. The vast majority of the cards in any given set are basically worthless, and unlike its competitors you can‚Äôt do anything with them to eventually get what you want. 

Now, some would argue that the pack points system covers this, but even that is by far the least generous. For example, the present ‚Äòmeta‚Äô deck is Dialga-Arceus, which uses 4 cards that are each -at a minimum-  1,250 to purchase with said points. At 57 gold per 10 pulls (which is the equivalent of 50 points) it would require 1,425 gold assuming your luck was atrocious. Assuming you bought the absolute best value packs (2x$99 for 690, along with a $19 for 120), a single card costs $217 worth of pack points.

And don‚Äôt be fooled by things like the trade system, because even *that* requires you to scrap cards to get enough tokens, with the higher rarity cards being prohibitively priced in terms of scrapped material.

I‚Äôve already spent more money than I‚Äôd care to admit on this game, but I‚Äôm stopping here. Maybe if they fix their systems I‚Äôll return, but considering how quickly they were willing to shift to such scummy practices, I‚Äôm not holding my breath.

US,2,2025-03-04,1.1.2,HonestThoughtsOnThis,Attention duelists,"First and foremost, there is no trading in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I‚Äôm guessing when it does get added, it will disappoint a lot of people based on how limited the F2P model is. 

Edit: Guess I was right!

This game does a good job of sucking you in at first, but it slows down quickly. 

To be clear, you can slowly build up a collection over time and get most of the cards you want. Your overall luck opening/picking cards will determine what you can battle with while building up your collection, but that luck can vary wildly. 

The game is light on content and has already resorted to repeating its first few ideas. 
It makes me wonder if this game was pushed out early to cover for delays elsewhere in the franchise. They have tons of media they could reference for ideas and they‚Äôve chosen to do only the most basic stuff. 

Battles are a large part of the experience if you aren‚Äôt spending money to open packs. The 20 card 2 copy limit offers its own pros and cons. Because of how limited the card pool is, the competitive aspect of the game is limited as well. Most battles are won based on playing two cards. They‚Äôre the only two cards that draw more cards, and if one person plays more of them, they‚Äôre probably going to win. Luck matters in all card games, but you can really feel it in this one. The game is up front about being casual though, so maybe the high variance is how they hope to achieve that. 

Evolutions require a unique card for each stage. Getting a basic, middle, and final evolution into play in sequence is tough with the limited card pool. Basically, high variance is (almost) everywhere. This will likely get better as more trainer cards and Pok√©mon with abilities come out. 

Even though battling others in PVP is the majority of the content right now, only the winning player gets a reward of 15 exp (not a lot), meaning if you start losing a game or just get a bad opener it‚Äôs reasonable to just concede and try again. There is no penalty for losses. This cheapens the overall experience for both sides. I don‚Äôt think they should add a penalty, but both players should be rewarded for completing a battle.

The F2P economy is a bit stingy. Two packs a day is great as a baseline, but the game doesn‚Äôt reward you much for actually playing. Daily missions give you additional pack every 3-4 days. If you level up you get a free pack. Packs contain five cards. 

Rarity also isn‚Äôt intuitive. Three diamond cards are more rare than most EX cards because EX cards often have alternate arts. This means you have more chances to see Pickachu EX than a Magneton because there are technically three different Pickachu EX cards that could end up in your pack.

Pack Points are the biggest issue for me and why I rate the game so poorly. I would be able to ignore the aggressiveness of the monetization if I was able to craft a few important low-rarity cards I can‚Äôt seem to open. 

I would love a way to convert duplicate cards into cards that I need. Five cards per pack with no guaranteed rares (three diamond of above) means you‚Äôll have gaps in your collection unless you have exceptional luck. The majority of packs you open will just be one and two diamond cards.

I was missing a two diamond card despite opening 40+ of the pack it was in. This means I needed to spend a week of pack points to get one uncommon. Each pack opened gives 5 points and two diamond cards cost 70 points, meaning all your free packs for about a week (2/day is 10 pack points a day). I happened to open my third copy a day later, not a great experience as a F2P. I was saving my pack points to get an EX card for my starving family. 

Here‚Äôs an example of just how stingy they are with rewards. They gave away a few free packs as part of their holiday event. These packs did not give pack points when opened. They won‚Äôt even let players get 15~ free pack points for a yearly holiday event. 

Trading could also fix this, but it isn‚Äôt in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I‚Äôm guessing trading will be very restricted because they stand to lose way too much money if people can complete their collection through trading. My guess is that each account will get some number of free trades and the rest will cost Pok√©gold. I just don‚Äôt see them letting people trade without ‚Äòtaking their cut‚Äô. 

Wonder picks are the other side of the economy and it is just engineered FOMO at its worst. Showing you that you ‚Äòpicked‚Äô incorrectly on failed attempts is definitely a choice when there are videos showing RNG is decided on packs and picks the instant resources are spent. You can and will get lucky, but the pool of cards is already large enough that finding even the right booster pack is a challenge. This is likely meant to be a catch-up mechanic for newer players and an occasional bonus for others. 

The UI needs work as well, it‚Äôs very barebones and not well organized. There are a lot of screens involved in obtaining cards that I wish were skippable. For another example, the best way to give your friends thanks is to go to the community display and scroll to the bottom. Going into the friends list to do the same thing requires 3 taps and some loading for each account manually. Deck building UI/search is also very poorly set up. 

Overall, it‚Äôs the most polished version of Pok√©mon Shop I‚Äôve played, but they really need to fix the reward structure. I think the game has potential, but right now it feels like it‚Äôs an undercooked cash cow first and a game second.","Attention duelistsFirst and foremost, there is no trading in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket yet.

First, let‚Äôs talk about the coin flips‚Äîbecause they are absolute garbage. I don‚Äôt know what kind of algorithm they‚Äôre using, but somehow, I manage to get tails almost every single time. Meanwhile, my opponents? Oh, they magically land heads whenever they need it most. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating when your entire strategy depends on a single flip, only for the game to screw you over, time and time again.

Then there‚Äôs the starting hands and card draws, which are somehow even worse. I swear, the game decides who‚Äôs going to win before the match even starts. Opponents always seem to draw their perfect combos right away, while I‚Äôm sitting there with a handful of useless cards and no Basic Pok√©mon. And if I somehow survive the first few turns? Good luck‚Äîbecause the opponent will still magically pull exactly what they need every time, while I continue drawing absolute garbage.

This isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbad luck.‚Äù This feels like blatant manipulation. How is it that my opponents always get their full setup in four turns while I struggle just to play the game? It‚Äôs like the system is rigged to punish certain players, making it feel less like a strategy game and more like a pre-determined loss simulator.

Pok√©mon TCG should be about skill, deck building, and actual fairness‚Äîbut instead, it feels like a broken, biased mess. Until they fix the coin flip mechanics, the card draw balance, and whatever shady matchmaking they have going on, this game is completely unplayable.","Started off good‚Ä¶If you enjoy constant bad luck, unfair matchmaking, and feeling like the game is actively working against you, then Pok√©mon TCG Live is the game for you.

US,4,2025-03-02,1.1.2,Kinbok420,"Good, could use a few things.","‚Ä¢ UI needs a rework. Takes too long to get anywhere, and is not obvious where you need to go sometimes.
For example; 
- You receive some packs in a gift, there should be an inventory menu so that you can immediately find and open said packs. 
- When you press complete on a quest there should not be a confirmation screen there, is completely unnecessary, just have an overlay at the bottom of the screen showing what you receive, no pop-up needed.

‚Ä¢ Opening a pack takes too long. Carousel of card packs is only there to create the illusion of choice anyway, the cards you will receive are decided as soon as you press open pack. Yet there are tons of conspiracies around it, (bent/tilted packs etc.), just let us open the pack, skip the carousel.

‚Ä¢ Wonder pick allowing you to pick a card only serves to frustrate the player, just shuffle then give me one. If I get to pick, make it so I can have a second pick at the cost of some resource.

‚Ä¢ The battle tutorial treats you worse than a small child, my 4 year old son doesn&#39;t even have the patience to click through that nonsense. All stages could easily be condensed into one or two stages instead of six or more.
Just give us an option to skip it, your other card game on the App Store already does a brilliant job of this.","Good, could use a few things.‚Ä¢ UI needs a rework. Takes too long to get anywhere, and is not obvious where you need to go sometimes.

US,3,2025-03-02,1.1.2,EffYewApple,Cute app hampered by obnoxious design,"First off, I do like that there&#39;s a digital version of this game. It&#39;s mostly focused around collecting, but the battle mode isn&#39;t bad, despite the way it was simplified being overly punishing anyone trying to build multitype decks (the energy allocation is entirely automatic, which.... I should be able to at least opt in to adjusting that, the automatic allocation is not good at what it does), and the way you can move the card renders around does a great job of selling pulling a holographic card and wiggling it to see it shine.

The problem is in the other parts of it. The quests section is incredibly laggy, with multi-second delay between pressing the button for it and it loading, the touch interface just doesn&#39;t work consistently enough for the long movements opening a booster or flipping a coin requires (I have had the same movement on my end just fail to register as a booster opening five times across two packs), and getting to the point of opening a booster pack requires like five button presses and a long drag (that, again, doesn&#39;t consistently work) to finally see your cards. It&#39;s super obnoxious and makes the core part of the app more annoying to deal with.

It&#39;s also a super money-hungry f2p but if you were expecting anything less from a digital version of cardboard gacha idk what to tell you.","Cute app hampered by obnoxious designFirst off, I do like that there&#39;s a digital version of this game.

US,1,2025-03-01,1.1.2,NotGrueben,Terrible Pull rates,"I am genuinely baffled at how impossible it is to pull a good card from a pack in this game. I actually think this game is predisposed to only give good pulls to certain people while others (aka only me as far as i know) cant get anything better than a full art that i already have. I actually have the worst rng luck known to man or someone is purposely hacking my pull rates because tell me why in the last (no exaggeration) 32 packs ive opened ive gotten 3 full arts 2 of which i already had. this is not an uncommon pattern either ill whiff every pack i open and if i actually do get something its a duplicate. my only hope is for a new set to drop so i have some semblance of hope to get anything good. speaking of which i just opened 11 packs of the new set and got one full art :| . How is that possible? 55 chances out of 96 total cards to pull, 26 of which are actually hits so WHY DID I GET 1 HIT??????? surely its not that impossible to get more than one reg full art, no ex, no holo ex, no rainbow, and esp no gold (i still dont have a gold yet and yet the majority of my friends who have close to half the amount of total cards i do have and yet have double the amount of rare cards that i do). Did i already mention the amount of dupes i get? If not lemme reiterate how soul crushing it is to finally open a pack and see a shiny border just for it to be my 4th pinser full art to go along w my 4th vaporeon full art and my 4th bulbasaur full art, not to mention my 4 reg charizard exs, or the numerous other 4 stacks of dupes i have. The packs are one thing because i do understand that beefing pull rates decentivizes people from playing but it shouldn‚Äôt be impossible to get ANY good cards, but thats not the most unreasonable part of this game not in the slightest. The real issue lies with the coin flips in battle. They have to have skewed the odds to land on tails 70% of the time because tell me why in my grind for hourglasses doing the solo battles it is genuinely impossible to land more than one heads at a time, if i can even do that! The majority of the better pvp cards in this game have some sort of coin flip mechanic that go along with its ability whether it be a single coin flip to 3 or if you are using celebi ex with serperior who knows how many coins, oh wait i do! Why 5 turns in a row starting from 2 coins all the way to 10 coin flips, i landed 1 heads? And it wasnt just one unlucky game, its  E V E R Y   S I N G L E   G A M E. It is genuinely ridiculous that every battle i do i could flip 20+ coins and land, if im extremely lucky, 2 heads TOTAL. And it seems to only be me for some reason because whoever im playing with seems to have no problem landing near max if not max head coin flips that they could achieve while im left twidling my thumbs as the misty card lands on tails on the first flip. Or my Moltress going 0/3 on the bench charge ability. Or my celebi ex landing 0/10 heads 4 turns in a row game after game. I cant rely on this mechanic anymore and had to change all my decks to incorpate the least possible coin flip mechanics possible. I shouldnt have to spend hours grinding hourglasses losing game after game because this game cant cut me a single break just to pull 1 card i already have. In conclusion this game has everything it needs to be good, good graphics, ez to understand game rules, and the unanimous joy of opening pokemon packs but its absolutely RUINED by the games inability to draw good cards or land any amount of head coin flips. I hope this review deters you from investing your time and most importantly, money. fix your game.","Terrible Pull ratesI am genuinely baffled at how impossible it is to pull a good card from a pack in this game.

US,1,2025-03-01,1.1.2,Shaazaam!,Torturous,"The game is initially fun, however, it quickly turns into a meaningless grind. There are several things the developers can do for quality of life, but it‚Äôs pretty clear the game is tailored toward those with the paid subscription/whales. 

- Pull rates are posted, but they aren‚Äôt accurate. 

- Battle coin tosses are broken. They favor paid players. Coin flip odds are worsened during matches against the computer as the difficulty increases. (The last point being that it‚Äôs a cheap and dumb way to make the computer tougher, rather than designing their decks or strategy to be tougher)

- All match start coin flips against the computer should be nullified and the player should just be given the option to go first or second. I never play a match against the computer if I get heads on the initial coin toss. Getting heads is punishment since you can‚Äôt place energy first. 

- The animations during battles are okay, but they aren‚Äôt a significant waste of time. There should be an option to turn those off. It is not needed, nor do I care that the game shows me the computer shuffling their deck for the 7th time after playing a Pokeball. 

- Excess cards are meaningless. Should be able to trade those in for more tickets to buy more packs

- The whole trade system is super broken. It‚Äôs not easy or convenient to find good trade partners. 

The game is good in concept, but it‚Äôs just a vessel to get you to spend money on fake cards.","TorturousThe game is initially fun, however, it quickly turns into a meaningless grind.
