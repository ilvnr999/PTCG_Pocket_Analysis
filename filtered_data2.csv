US,5,2025-02-05,1.1.0,henry sayner,"Love this game, but two critiques",First off love this game it’s simple does not try to be anything flashy and is exactly what it advises. However there are two issues with the game that need to be fixed. First there is no true reward for playing the random battles after completing the solo battle as you can only get 15 exp per battle won and a skip ticket if the other player thanks you. This system would be fine if there wasn’t a level cap and skip ticket actually were able to be used on hour glasses more than once a month (10 individual hourglass and 40 multiple hour glasses). If you’re going to have skip tickets and hour glasses at least make the shop refresh 2 weeks instead of a month. Also maybe add like a three win reward in battles that gives an hour glass as reward or the potential for one.,"Love this game, but two critiquesFirst off love this game it’s simple does not try to be anything flashy and is exactly what it advises.

For starters their shouldn’t be a limit to how much you can trade
It’s not the worst to only trade with friends but I think there should be a wonder trade and/or link trade mode as well
The only other thing is I think for randomized trades it makes sense to only trade the same rarity of cards but that shouldn’t apply to friends because if somebody thinks a trade is unfair then all they need to do is stop the trade","Trading needs a few changes to make a little easierI love the game it super fun to play and all but the new trading system is broken

I haven’t spent money and when playing these sort of games I tend to not have the best of luck. You get two free 5 card packs per day, but you can earn tickets to get said packs sooner (up to a certain point per month, which could use this limit to be removed since paying players have more advantages as in more card packs and special rewards in way of unique cards and cosmetics). 

Battling is pretty fun and quick. The animations give a nice touch to the match, giving you more of a sense of satisfaction seeing some moves being played. Timers are in place forcing people to make a move or a move is made for them, usually in the form of passing on their turn, allowing you to keep going and not be stuck with someone that just wants you to concede to win the match.

The one time I reached out to the support for this app, it was slow in responding and not helpful, nor understanding. Their instructions were lacking and missing some steps, enough so I mistakingly got two free premium trials on the same account instead of one on each account. After weeks the reply was that they could not do anything in order to keep the game fair.

The trading system so far in only for paying customers. Example being that in order for me to trade any board besides a common, I have to trade 5 cards of that rarity to the game for tokens to be able to trade a sixth card to my friend. Rarer cards will give back more tokens, but you will always have to give a lot more than you get in return for tokens. Thus unless you pay for packs, you will be able to trade 1 to 4 cards with the free tokens they give at the beginning, then it’s up to you to give the cards you have to be able to trade. It would have been less greedy and more friendly to free tokens play players if common cards and dust were exchangeable for tokens, example of 20 tokens per card or 20 tokens for 100 dust. But in this state it is really only intended for people that are willing to pay money.

Overall I am a happy with the new content/events that come out to keep you engaged. The gap between pay to play and free players is definitely felt a lot more in the beginning of a release, but over quite a long period of time you can earn good enough cards to be a match for the pay to play players. In essence it is a pay to win mechanic at the release of something, but over months of time you can have decks as complete/powerful as the paying players. If the paid content was purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3. I will update this review as things change in the future.

—————UPDATE—————
February 5 2025:

I would like to thank the development team for generous gift of trade tokens I received this morning!! That was an unexpected nice surprise! 

I have kept playing everyday and am enjoying the new live events. The addition of an EX available as a promo prize card is exciting and has a potential of helping towards making the new trade feature more usable for free to play players. If the rate at which EX and rarer cards is highly increased, then it definitely would be another way of tackling the trade token conversion rate problem. 
I have a slight concern in approaching the problem this way, where the overall value of the EX cards would go down due to the increased ease in getting them. Maybe a way to avoid that could be in having a non stop single player event that rewards EX level rarity cards to use specifically for exchanging for trade tokens. 
That could be an innovative way of solving the problem instead of adding trade in token value to common cards and changing the token exchange rates. Not knowing the difficulty in programming these changes in the game, I do not know which would be the cleaner way for the development team to approach this. What I do know is that a change is desperately needed to make this trade feature more realistically available for free to play players. This is not discounting that it is still not easy nor cheap for paying players! At the end of the day though this feature if easier to use for paying players due to the increased amount of cards they receive, thus creating a bigger imbalance between paying and free to play players.
If the bigger difference between paying and free play players is purposely introduced, I would suggest adding battle lobbies for just free to play players, making it more enjoyable for that community having more balanced deck opponents in relation to how many cards can be collected for free play players.

I hope the different suggestions I gave above will be seen and considered to bring back more balance between paying and free play players. Since the update I have used the trade feature to trade common cards with my friends. I haven’t traded anything requiring tokens in the hopes that someday there will be changes that will allow trading rarer cards cheaper than what is realistically only fairly doable with the tokens given for free as gifts from the developer team.

I will update the review and try to keep it shorter as things change.","A bit greedyPlayed for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun.

If the paid content was purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3. I will update this review as things change in the future.

—————UPDATE—————
February 5 2025:

I would like to thank the development team for generous gift of trade tokens I received this morning!! That was an unexpected nice surprise! 

I have kept playing everyday and am enjoying the new live events. The addition of an EX available as a promo prize card is exciting and has a potential of helping towards making the new trade feature more usable for free to play players. If the rate at which EX and rarer cards is highly increased, then it definitely would be another way of tackling the trade token conversion rate problem. 
I have a slight concern in approaching the problem this way, where the overall value of the EX cards would go down due to the increased ease in getting them. Maybe a way to avoid that could be in having a non stop single player event that rewards EX level rarity cards to use specifically for exchanging for trade tokens. 
That could be an innovative way of solving the problem instead of adding trade in token value to common cards and changing the token exchange rates. Not knowing the difficulty in programming these changes in the game, I do not know which would be the cleaner way for the development team to approach this. What I do know is that a change is desperately needed to make this trade feature more realistically available for free to play players. This is not discounting that it is still not easy nor cheap for paying players! At the end of the day though this feature if easier to use for paying players due to the increased amount of cards they receive, thus creating a bigger imbalance between paying and free to play players.
If the bigger difference between paying and free play players is purposely introduced, I would suggest adding battle lobbies for just free to play players, making it more enjoyable for that community having more balanced deck opponents in relation to how many cards can be collected for free play players.

I hope the different suggestions I gave above will be seen and considered to bring back more balance between paying and free play players. Since the update I have used the trade feature to trade common cards with my friends. I haven’t traded anything requiring tokens in the hopes that someday there will be changes that will allow trading rarer cards cheaper than what is realistically only fairly doable with the tokens given for free as gifts from the developer team.

I will update the review and try to keep it shorter as things change.",Positive

The anxiously awaited “trade” feature is not trading. Basically, you throw a card at another player (whose collection you can’t see) and hope they throw something you want back at you. It also is severely limited in how many times you can do it, and requires yet another resource to initiate. Again: you have no idea what you are getting back (or if you will get anything, since the “partner” can reject the trade outright). You would be better off just buying paper cards. I’ve enjoyed just opening the half packs and collecting. If you want something to spend 5-10 minutes a day on, sure. Just don’t make the mistake of spending money.","Middle of the roadOther than spending ridiculous amounts of money, there isn’t really a way to collect everything in the packs, due to the massive variety of rarities, and the pull rates.

US,1,2025-02-05,1.1.0,ChocoApples,Needs Improvement,"I felt pretty excited when this game first came out. It’s nice to be able to see the nice effects from holos and EX cards. I wish that it didn’t cost so much to open packs of cards. With how many sets there are and the lack of currency you get for opening packs, I have yet to complete a single set. I think it’s a great game to check into when waking up and before going to bed. That’s about it.

The battle system is terrible. It takes 3 points for a win. If you knock out an EX card, you gain 2 points. If you knock out a regular card, you’ll be rewarded with 1 point. Most of the time, someone happens to pull an EX as their first card. It pretty much decides the game. There’s no time to try to compete. It’s even worse when the opponent has a Pokemon card that allows them to gain energy and place the energy onto whichever Pokemon. It makes it way too easy for the person to win since they get an infinite supply of energy and you don’t have a strong enough card, nor an energy generating card. I think they should require 6 points for the win to allow people time to try to make a comeback or be on an even playing field. 

I probably would only recommend this game to a child. Sure, it’ll be something they quickly become bored of but at least they’ll be in awe for a few minutes each time they open a pack of cards.","Needs ImprovementI felt pretty excited when this game first came out.

Let’s get one thing straight: Pokemon TCG Pocket is an Abomasnow’nation to both Pokemon fans and trading card game enthusiasts. What could have been an exciting, mobile friendly way to enjoy the Pokemon TCG is instead a soulless, money grabbing mess that strips away everything fun about collecting and battling.

Gacha Mechanics “Masquerain’ing” as a Card Game

Get it? Get it?! Any who…this game isn’t about strategy or deck building. It’s about daily pack openings with an aggressive monetization model. You don’t “collect” cards in a meaningful way. You pray to the random number generator gods and hope to Arceus you pull something decent. The odds can’t be that bad though,  right? Right? Well, you tell me. 0.050% chance you open a rare pack. You read that right. To add insult to injury-there’s no system to exchange duplicate cards for in-game currency, meaning the useless extra copies you’ll pull 99.950% of the time just sit there, mocking you. Meanwhile, in-game currency can be used to unlock cards, but there’s no direct way to work toward the ones you actually want. It’s an artificial, exploitative system designed to keep you chasing the next pack instead of building a deck you actually enjoy.

A Trading System That’s a Total Muk-up

The recent addition of a trading feature should have been a saving grace, but it’s somehow even worse than expected. Also, don’t skip past the fact that I stated trading is a recent addition. I hope they released the game as Pokemon CG at first! Anyway, instead of a simple, straightforward way to exchange cards with friends, we get a convoluted mess of “Trade Stamina” and “Trade Tokens” because God forbid we just trade cards like a normal human. It feels like the developers actively sat down and asked, How can we make this as tedious and anti consumer as possible? Seems they forgot what the T in TCG stands for. 

Watered-Down Gameplay That Insults TCG Fans

If you were hoping for deep, strategic gameplay like the physical Pokemon TCG or even Pokemon TCG Live, you’re in for a disappointment. Battles feel shallow, uninspired, and largely automated. There’s no real room for skill. It just another case of “tap the screen and hope you win.” The fact that Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel can faithfully recreate its complex card game while Pokemon delivers something that feels designed for a Slowpoke. It’s beyond embarrassing.

And it’s not just about depth. The matchmaking is a complete joke. You will be matched regularly with level 30+ players before you ever see level 10 all while under the Beginner tab. There’s no balance, no proper ranking system and a whole lot of Unown. Pure chaos. Worse yet, losing a match nets zero rewards. No points, no progress—just wasted time.

Repetitive Meta That Kills Any Variety

Even if you suffer through the awful matchmaking and dumbed-down gameplay, you’ll quickly notice that every match feels exactly the same. The same overpowered cards dominate the meta, making deck variety non-existent. If you’re not running those cards, you’re at an instant disadvantage. Combine that with the ridiculous card acquisition system, and it’s clear the game is designed to keep you grinding endlessly or spending money just to remain competitive.

Final Verdict: Stay Far Away

Pokemon TCG Pocket is everything wrong with modern mobile gaming—paywalled progression, shallow mechanics, and a deliberately broken economy that treats players like cash cows. If you’re looking for a way to enjoy the Pokemon TCG, do yourself a favor and play literally anything else.

Spending real money on gold and then opening packs with them has such a small chance of actual giving you good cards that it’s not worth it.

This new update also introduced trading, which makes you grind up all those valuable cards you wasted hundreds of dollars getting just to trade one card. Seriously, you have to grind up 5 EX Pokemon just to trade for one. And both parties have to do that for the trade to work. It’s scummy, especially when the game is literally marketed as a tcg. This is a strong deterrent away from anyone actually using the trading feature","All downhill since releaseThis game was fun on release when it gave you a bunch of hourglasses and stuff to get a bunch of new cards, but since then it’s been downhill, and now feels downright predatory. 

Spending real money on gold and then opening packs with them has such a small chance of actual giving you good cards that it’s not worth it.

US,4,2025-02-05,1.1.0,Cmartin411,A little pricey,"Absolutely love the idea of this game. But it is very much pay to win and enjoy. When there isn’t an event happening you really only earn about two to maybe three packs a day. While this allows for the creation of lower tier decks, obtaining the best cards or the rarer full art cards is very difficult. The full arts don’t do anything the regular cards do, but seeing giant gaps in the collection every set is really disheartening. I wish there was some way I could trade in the over 80 copies of Bulbasaur I’ve collected and put them towards purchasing any other card. So unless you’re lucky to pull one of the full art cards you’re looking for, be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars just for the resources to buy one. Overall the game is great, but there really needs to be a way to cash in the vast amount of lower tier cards you’re going to obtain. Something like the way other games like Hearthstone do it would make this game perfect in my eyes. Maybe one day something like this will be added.","A little priceyAbsolutely love the idea of this game. But it is very much pay to win and enjoy.

US,2,2025-02-05,1.1.0,TGromps,Dev’s not making changes/QoL,"Personally not a fan of apps never making request changes, especially QoL ones. Still no Dark Mode, trading can only be done if you destroy Holos/3diamond rares, ex cards, and art rare cards ( ex: one ex trade requires BOTH sides to sacrifice 20 holos each or at least four ex cards/art rares). I’ve been playing with a subscription since pretty early on and the expectation of how many duplicates needed to be sacrificed in one trade is absurd. 
Flipping coins for paralysis/status effects when the pokemon is dead/0hp, battle events are just win 5 in a row or 45 total so they’re just grinds and not very reflective of your strategy/knowledge, Profile Card Displays are shown with the card minimized outside of the Display Case as if it’s an item in a menu and NOT in any way an actual Display of the card on your profile, 15 decks can only be made which the more you battle and open packs the more you understand how awful it is, flares must be manually and individually put on every time you make your 20 card decks so you end up just not wanting to even use them, the visual card overlay flares ONLY appear for 1 second when you put your card onto the field or use its attacks/abilities (so they’re un-flared the entire match on the playmat), binder/display flares show a static image unless you click on them to ‘observe’ them up close, you can’t report other players in-game for inappropriate names (which I highly suggest as a feature in anything kids play as well), you can’t buy multiples of anything in the shop/event shops in one transaction, you have to keep buying things over and over till it’s out, only 3 of the tons (and more to come) badges can be displayed on your profile, the profile trophies only give 30-100 stardust (I have 43,500 stardust, if you ever can win 10,000 pvp matches you’re getting 100 stardust for it), can only open one promo pack at a time, once you get five shop tickets for the day any other ‘Thanks’ you get just give you a notification mark and you can collect them all but they do nothing, there are not many icons in the game so you just all sorta have the same fiveish and that heavily contributes to the lack of profile/individuality in the game (but they ARE ADDING MORE! So credit to that! Would be nice if it was just any card you had could be your profile pic!), and there’s an odd amount of small time-wasting; can’t use or do anything after using pokeball or anything that makes the deck shuffle, post game screen has three pages of odd stats that don’t really matter to either parties (including a screen that only tells you that you don’t get anything for losing) then they place the thanks button suddenly above the next button so if you’re clicking through your pages you accidentally don’t thank them and just leave the page. 

It’s a ton of these small things that in other games devs will see themselves or hear about and then fix, but this game the only thing I’ve seen slightly assessed from the devs was that THEY will handle to inappropriate names… no report button needed apparently, yet I still run into them… I’m not sure why at bare minimum dark mode isn’t here..

US,3,2025-02-05,1.1.0,OverlyVerbose1,New trade system is abysmal,"The trade system is godawful. It’s somehow both too expensive for normal players and too restrictive for those who splash large amounts of money on the game. The conversion rate on the trade currency means that, unless you only want to trade commons that pretty much everyone already has, you have to have a whale-like amount of rares to throw away. But that itself is an issue, since if you have that many rares, you most likely have every card and would have no use for trading (this is made worse by the fact that the very rare cards that whales would trade for can’t be traded). It’s a system that has an identity crisis. It can’t help casual players fill out their decklists and it can’t help whales hunt down the rare cards they don’t yet have. Which leads to the obvious question: who *is* it for? *edit: apparently they’re “continuing to consider the possibility of improving the trading function,” as stated on their social media (as translated from Japanese, so may not be their exact wording), and in the meantime they’ve gifted 1000 trade tokens, or about two EX/star trades, to go along with the previous 500 token gift. Not to sound like a miser, but this gift and/or fix seems… a little anemic. Hopefully it’s a sign that they’re going to adjust prices to be less absurd, but I’m not holding my breath on that front.","New trade system is abysmalThe trade system is godawful.

TLDR: this game is a money grab for nostalgic millennials. It’s too slow, and too biased towards exorbitantly expensive pay-to-play, and the game odds are manipulated. 

Additions: 

Changed to 1 star because the in-game purchases are predatory. If you spend real money to get gold, the gold cost of “ten packs” will increase, forcing you to purchase more to try and afford it. Not okay. 

The versus battling has nothing to help casual players. There are 2-3 toxic deck strategies that are used by the majority of players online, making battling extremely un-fun and difficult to progress, which is painful because versus is the only way to consistently gain experience points and progress. 

Trading is completely unusable. The barrier of entry is so high, that the average player can only afford to do a few trades period. 

The booster pack pull rate odds are manipulated. They boost them at random times to get you addicted pull them back to get you to pay for more packs. 

—-
Let me start out by saying I absolutely adore this game. I will be a player for the foreseeable future.

That said, the reward system needs rebalancing, and the coin flip odds are not 50/50. 

First, many of the rewards you receive can only be exchanged for things that don’t help you advance in the game. Second, there are many things that do not give you experience that logically should, making it difficult to progress. Third, there are not enough ways to earn pack hourglasses after you reach a certain point in the game. I used to be able to open 5–6 packs per day, now I can only open the one or two given each day because I have cleared all of the solo battles that give pack hourglasses.

On the coin flip subject, certain cards appear to have different odds. Additionally, the very first coin flip dramatically influences the rest of your results. If you get heads first, you often get mostly heads. If you get tails first, often times you get all tails. Very irritating.","Highly Irritating, and riggedOriginal review below.

The Bad: Boy oh boy this game just wants to bleed your wallet dry. The leveling system is fast at first but eventually will become a slow grind. Especially because of the small exp you earn per battle. Why would anyone want to play a game that requires more work and less reward. The trading system is also very awful! Aside from locking the rarest cards available for trading… the cost of trading a card is also ridiculous. For example: It costs 500 trade tokens to trade 1 EX card. To earn trade tokens you would need to exchange some cards… since Commons and Uncommons have no value, you can’t exchange those for trade tokens, instead you have to exchange your rares and 1 star cards. 1 Star cards can earn you 125 trade tokens. You need 500 to trade one 1-Star cards. You basically need to exchange four 1-star cards to be able to trade for one! Never mind the fact that you also need duplicates to obtain Flairs. The premium pass is also overly priced. For $10 monthly subscription… you get a premium promo card and about 5 cosmetic items and an extra pack per day. For those wanting to complete their card sets… this is a burn in your pocket. You are pretty much spending $10 on 1 digital promo card… while the extra pack can gain you cards you can normally get during regular play and it’s not even guaranteed you will get super rares.

I hope one day the FCC takes action against the pokemon co for allowing them to push gambling onto children.  Pulling cards at random is one thing from a pack but on a phone it is completely generated and manipulated. The card you need is never the one you’ll get and you give us no way to earn them individually. Unless you  earn a currency from gambling opening packs.

The game is fun, you open packs and get your favorite Pokemon and it can be done for free, with the option to buy gold to get the cards that you need faster. That said, the trading system it’s very punishing and unbalanced. You need to get rid of several valuable cards just to get one of the same value. This, instead of rewarding the players that spend time in the game, pushes the users to spend even more money, so they can get more cards to trade for tokens. The only solution I see is to update the trade tokens system so they can be obtained easier.

I want to enjoy this game since I pulled some cool looking darkrais but even finding the basic 2 diamond cards I need is going to take me literal WEEKS. Let me disenchant the bad cards you make me pull in my packs so I can trade for the cards you refuse to give me",Negative

But in order to drive the car, you must walk to the gas station to fill up a tank and bring it back to the car as it will only start if entirely filled up with gas, you have to pay for “car time” or wait 24 hours before driving again, and you’re banned from using a friend’s car. It’s use is core to your daily life, but so practically prohibitive that you DoorDash expensive meals instead.

Besides some minor gripes with the community tab and coin flip dependent card battling, I was overall thoroughly impressed. I was very excited for the future of this game until the trading feature was finally revealed.

This thing is USELESS in its current state. Tradable cards are arbitrarily restricted to one star rarity, which means any higher rarity cards you find duplicates of are basically useless and can’t be traded for other rare cards you might be missing.

Dailies: we need more daily activities to entice us to open the app beyond just a free pull or two. How about a new challenge every day with a pull as the reward?

It could be a goal in battles or a deck that somebody at HQ put together that we have to beat. It would take you guys three seconds to make a competitive deck that people could view as a challenge.

Rewards for online play: 15 XP is a ridiculous reward for beating someone that could range from completely incompetent to incredibly good at the game. 

How about we add skill based matchmaking? Better players are rewarded more? 

Better trading system: the current trading system is asinine and easily the worst part of the game as it currently stands. There is no way to tell what somebody is willing to trade for or what they even are willing to trade at all. You can only trade with friends. I don’t wanna have to go onto the Reddit trading megathread to trade my Pokémon.

US,1,2025-02-03,1.1.0,Jadon2468,"Love the game, but the cash grab tactics are just sad","*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention * 

I dont know if the developers will actually read this but I hope they will. I absolutely love this game and have played it daily for months. However there are a few greedy tactics used by the developers in order to encourage spending money that I think should be changed or reworked.

The first in irritation and most obvious is the fact that you can’t open 10 packs with a free pack available. I think this is unnecessarily slimy from the developers side. I don’t want to always only use my hourglasses or gold when opening 10 packs, especially when I am saving for a new set that is coming out. The game is going to make great money either way, so I feel like its extra to not allow the player to choose what kind of currency is used for opening a pack. (Its currently always the free ones first). 

The second is the limit on hour glass purchases. I understand why this one is somewhat necessary from a bottom line standpoint, although I think its taken to the extreme. You can earn shop tickets through playing the game to use to purchase hourglasses from the shop, but only in a limited amount that gets refreshed monthly. However there is also a limit on the amount of shop tickets you can earn in a day. The fact that the developers felt the need to limit both how many hourglasses you can buy and also how many daily tickets you can earn is ridiculous. Limiting one is understandable, limiting both is cruel and greedy. Every month I purchase all of the hourglasses possible almost as soon it refreshes. But it still takes almost the whole previous months worth of work to earn those shop tickets to be able to buy the hour glasses in the first place. I dont understand the need for a limit on both especially considering how harsh each limit is.

There are more, but this is already quite long and those two are the most glaring. Most of my friends have quit playing this game because of one or both of these tactics. Does the slight amount of extra money gained through these tactics really outweigh the discontent and annoyance felt by the playerbase? I doubt it, and I bet player retention would sky rocket if these were changed.","Love the game, but the cash grab tactics are just sad*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention *

It’s incredibly disappointing to invest this much into the game, only to be locked out of reasonable trades. If I’m putting my money into your system, why not at least allow a way to exchange gold cards for packet points? That would give players a fair way to obtain cards they’re missing without feeling completely restricted by an arbitrary trading system.

US,1,2025-02-02,1.1.0,AirBear-11,Hard no right now,"The first turn mechanic is unfair. The huge cash grab with the new trading system, the game shouldn’t be allowed to call it a trading card game. Since the new expansion all the coin flips have suddenly turned into the best flips the opponent can get to beat you. On top of that your first draw is going to be trash. Not sure how that works with a 20 card deck but I’ve tried so many different ratios and combinations. Even took a deck down to like 4 trainer cards and still draw them first 90% of the time given probability chances I do get it but when it happens all the time I don’t feel that’s how those odds are supposed to work. I could be wrong though. However, I hate to say this but the original TCG online is much more worth your time. Save the frustration and stick with that for now. This game is not Pokemon.","Hard no right nowThe first turn mechanic is unfair. The huge cash grab with the new trading system, the game shouldn’t be allowed to call it a trading card game.

US,1,2025-02-02,1.1.0,Jay Scarlet1,This new update ruined everything..,"As a long-time Pokémon fan me and my family we LOVED Pokémon TCG Pocket, and we were so excited to gift each other rare cards “trading.” However, after the latest update, the trading system is a huge disappointment. Trading is supposed to be the core feature, but instead, it’s filled with unnecessary restrictions and expensive requirements.

The game forces players to use trade hourglasses and trade tokens just to exchange cards of the same rarity, making what should be a simple process overly complicated. Instead of encouraging fun and fair trading between friends and family, it feels like the game is pushing players to spend money. My siblings and I used to play together, trading cards and building decks, but after this update, both my brother and sister quit. It’s frustrating that a game called Pokémon TRADING CARDS Pocket makes trading so difficult.

Many other players feel the same way, and unless the developers listen to the community and fix this system, more people will likely leave the game. If Pokémon TCG Pocket truly wants to live up to its name, it needs a fair, accessible, and enjoyable trading system.","This new update ruined everything..As a long-time Pokémon fan me and my family we LOVED Pokémon TCG Pocket, and we were so excited to gift each other rare cards “trading.” However, after the latest update, the trading system is a huge disappointment.

Whales are the only people who could afford to use the trade feature, but because they don’t let 2* or above cards get traded, they have no reason to use trades.

Some of us just want to obtain cards we’ve been missing since launch to try new decks in PvP (notably, with cards that are not that rare - still chasing kabutops myself), but the current trading system doesn’t really enable this (meaning it seems to not serve any purpose at all).","TradingTCGP is fun in a lot of ways, but it has issues, and the number one issue right now is the new trading system.

Some of us just want to obtain cards we’ve been missing since launch to try new decks in PvP (notably, with cards that are not that rare - still chasing kabutops myself), but the current trading system doesn’t really enable this (meaning it seems to not serve any purpose at all).",Negative
US,2,2025-02-01,1.1.0,zactishey,"Nostalgic and Enjoyable, Until Progress Slows Down","I’ve spent a few days with Pokémon TCG pocket, and for the most part I’m really enjoying things. The daily rotation between building decks, battling, and opening packs is simple and exciting at times. I’ve already pulled a few rare cards that make logging in every day worthwhile. As a 30-something adult this game takes me back to my days in the late 90’s opening Jungle boosters at the game shop!

While player levels 1-15 quickly load you up with booster packs and cards to build your deck+collection, after that things really slow down. This is about the time new players will give-in and start to spend real money if they want to scratch the inevitable booster pack “itch” that can’t be scratched by the daily reset or level up rewards. The developer has put most rewards jusssssst out of reach to make spending real money a “well, why not?” situation.

Still, there’s enough to do here that I’ll be coming back for 15-20 minutes a day to enjoy opening a free booster, snagging a Wonder pick, and jumping into a few battles. Battling is fun as well, but I wonder how quickly things will change once players are loaded up with EX cards and a meta is established.

Update 2/1/25: New booster pack variety has been fun, but the pull rate for rare cards is brutal. Trading is a disaster. If you’re not a subscriber you really won’t get much out of TCG Pocket past level 30.","Nostalgic and Enjoyable, Until Progress Slows DownI’ve spent a few days with Pokémon TCG pocket, and for the most part I’m really enjoying things.

As it is, it becomes very repetitive and boring quickly. I gave it a much longer try then other games due to the brand power of Pokémon, however, without trading all you can do is open 2 packs a day of the same duplicate cards. There’s no way to get new cards or the cards you need to complete sets without just randomly opening 2 packs a day. It’s a great model but when you realize they aren’t opening up trading and the only other way is to spend money on gold. Until there are more goals to complete to let you open packs or get the cards you specifically need, it just looks like a boring money grab after a day or 2.

Edit: trading is such a mess up, I’m almost in shock. I thought with the addition of trading my review would change to more positivity. The system for trading is without a doubt the worst I’ve ever seen.

I haven’t spent money and when playing these sort of games I tend to not have the best of luck. You get two free 5 card packs per day, but you can earn tickets to get said packs sooner (up to a certain point per month, which could use this limit to be removed since paying players have more advantages as in more card packs and special rewards in way of unique cards and cosmetics). 

Battling is pretty fun and quick. The animations give a nice touch to the match, giving you more of a sense of satisfaction seeing some moves being played. Timers are in place forcing people to make a move or a move is made for them, usually in the form of passing on their turn, allowing you to keep going and not be stuck with someone that just wants you to concede to win the match.

The one time I reached out to the support for this app, it was slow in responding and not helpful, nor understanding. Their instructions were lacking and missing some steps, enough so I mistakingly got two free premium trials on the same account instead of one on each account. After weeks the reply was that they could not do anything in order to keep the game fair.

The trading system so far in only for paying customers. Example being that in order for me to trade any board besides a common, I have to trade 5 cards of that rarity to the game for tokens to be able to trade a sixth card to my friend. Rarer cards will give back more tokens, but you will always have to give a lot more than you get in return for tokens. Thus unless you pay for packs, you will be able to trade 1 to 4 cards with the free tokens they give at the beginning, then it’s up to you to give the cards you have to be able to trade. It would have been less greedy and more friendly to free tokens play players if common cards and dust were exchangeable for tokens, example of 20 tokens per card or 20 tokens for 100 dust. But in this state it is really only intended for people that are willing to pay money.

Overall I am a happy with the new content/events that come out to keep you engaged. The gap between pay to play and free players is definitely felt a lot more in the beginning of a release, but over quite a long period of time you can earn good enough cards to be a match for the pay to play players. In essence it is a pay to win mechanic at the release of something, but over months of time you can have decks as complete/powerful as the paying players. If the paid content for purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3.

However, mirroring other reviews, slow players are incredibly irritating. You might be winning so the other person will seemingly stop playing and will only make a move right before their timer is about to run out, probably in the hopes that you will just give up and concede. Very annoying. Additionally, the new trade feature isn&#39;t great because you pick a card you are willing to trade and send it to a friend and MAYBE they will offer a card you don&#39;t own, but usually not. I would much rather be able to show what I am looking for, or at least for there to be prompts letting me know if the card I picked is a card that friend does not own. I haven&#39;t been using the feature due to this. For example, I have most of the Genetic Apex pack filled out, but never pulled a Gardevoir card. It would be nice if I could just say that that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for on my trade profile. Otherwise the only offers you receive are likely going to be cards you do not need.","Awesome, but has some issuesI am obsessed with this game. Deck building and battling is very fun, and it&#39;s always exciting to open new card packs. However, mirroring other reviews, slow players are incredibly irritating. You might be winning so the other person will seemingly stop playing and will only make a move right before their timer is about to run out, probably in the hopes that you will just give up and concede.

My problem is that as of recently my card pulls are nonexistent. The difference between an account who puts money in it and an account who plays for free is astronomical when it comes to pack pulls. And with the new Dialga and palkia booster packs, I’ve opened 13 so far and I have yet to get any cards of rarity. I go on YouTube and see players who spend money on the game (this is obvious due to all the paid gold they use) and within their first 10 packs they’ve got enough decent pulls to even create a new deck. I’d also like to mention, why? Why rig the wonder pick? My cousin who is the only person I have in my friends list from real life, has pulled 2 God packs, and never once was a I able to wonder pick any of them. In fact you guys give me his worst packs, a wonder pick with no rarities. I even remember when he pulled his second God pack, I told him not to open another pack to see if I can wonder pick, and guess what? His God pack never showed up, and when his wonder pick did, it was a normal pack with (once again) nonexistent rarity. If I don’t pull something by the end of this week I don’t think I’m gonna bother collecting cards and playing anymore.
