US,1,2025-02-10,1.1.1,Gwinnythepoo1211,PvP issues!,"Quite honestly the PVP has become completely broken with the latest update, adding darkrai into the field. 
The game was already completely luck based with about 1% skill involved. Now it’s gotten 1000% worst than before. 

If they follow their trend they will eventually add YET ANOTHER win streak event. Which completely unrealistic for the casual player base. I have unlocked every medal and have spent plenty already into the game and yet I can’t stand the pvp. From the coin flips, to the rng factor of starting hands compared to your opponent, and to the added factor of top decking exactly what you need for the situation or your opponent doing just that to squeeze out a victory. 

At the end of the day the medals and achievements are more of a sign of how lucky you can get, rather than a testament to your strategic mindset in the card battling field. Which is quite honestly sad. 

Fix suggestions: if they implemented a banning system for their event pvp modes to balance the field it would make it a lot more enjoyable. You could keep the open random pvp event for a “free-for-all” mode where every card can be used. 

However as it stands pvp is basically worthless and more of a question, who’s luckier? You? Or your opponent?","PvP issues!Quite honestly the PVP has become completely broken with the latest update, adding darkrai into the field.

Anyway, my first issue is with the UI, it’s 2025… we know what looks and feels good to use. They don’t care, it’s pages and sub pages for no reason. For a game with almost no features why are there 30+ pages??? It’s so bloated to distract you from the lack of content. 

They released the trading system. You can only trade with friends, and can’t trade more than a 1/3 of the cards in the game. And more than half will take all your trading energy/currency.

Of course this game has 12+ forms of currency!!!

Shop tickets, special black tickets, hour glasses, golden hour glasses, gold bars, event energy, trading energy, stardust, premium tickets(paid system) and let’s not forget the three emblem currencies.

After opening 250 charizard packs I’m still missing 8 cards from the set. Like why.

On top of this, they’re keeping cards behind a paywall. Every month they have a special card (you use a 12th currency for) that only pass holders can obtain. 

I thought pay to win/ pay for advantages was illegal and that’s why cosmetics are being sold so much.

US,5,2025-02-10,1.1.1,mbk19181,Give it a try!,"Pros:
It’s Pokémon! The art is really well done. Battle system is simple to learn. Auto battle feature makes it even easier. Deck building is easy and intuitive. The Pokémon themselves are cute, cool and fun to collect. They keep introducing new cards and variations on old ones which keeps the game fresh.
Cons:
Battle system is a bit too simple once you understand it. Going second is an advantage that doesn’t exist in the original card game. The energy supply system is better in the original card game and more fair. Needs a power balance as Charizard EX is simply too OP, capable of dealing over 200 damage which is more than any Pokémon has. Moltres EX can add 1-4 energy every turn meaning you could have Charizard at full charge in 3-4 moves (counting evolutions). It’s really just poor balancing. I think power creep could be an issue. If you keep increasing power to match charizard, you risk power creep and then anything under 200 hp that deals less than 200 damage will no longer be viable. If you work out a battle system closer to the original card game where there are energy cards and both players have equal opportunity to add them, it could help balance a bit without the power creep being a factor. 
Final take: play the game! Don’t take it too seriously and just have fun and collect Pokémon. It’s great for what it is and I’m confident it will continue to be interesting with added card sets and new solo challenges. If you want the nostalgia, you’ll get the nostalgia. If you are new to Pokémon, this is a really fun way to start.","Give it a try!Pros:

US,1,2025-02-09,1.1.1,Rob.J.R.,Algorithm,"This game has too many rigged algorithms. It honestly reminds me of Marvel Snap. Marvel Snap became a huge failure. Pocket has algorithms you’ll start to notice. Like using a deck and losing to Celebii 5 times in a row. Then switching your deck to beat Celebii, now only to fight Misty decks 5 times in a row. Also going first is a huge disadvantage. I’ve gone first 10+ times in a row. That’s not “random”.

Right now everything is based around Drudigon stalling the game, which means certain decks have no chance attacking, cause the Pokemon will just KO itself. The other way is energy manipulation. Misty, Serperior, Moltres, and Gardevoir. If you’re not using a deck involving those cards then games are a lot slower for you.

There’s also 4 cards that basically go into every deck. 2 Pokeballs, and 2 Professor Oaks. So it’s more a deck of 16 cards, not 20. There’s a bunch of filler cards that you’ll never see used. Every card should be designed with a potential use over another card, giving you options. Some cards here are just pure garbage to put in packs.

After playing for 3-4 months this is my honest opinion of the state of the game. It has become very stale and boring.","AlgorithmThis game has too many rigged algorithms.

US,2,2025-02-08,1.1.1,mega166,CPU Battles need serious balancing,"CPU battles need a ridiculous amount of balancing. I’ve maybe had a handful of matches that were challenging without cheapness and were won by strategy, as it should be. 

But typically, CPU battles go one of two ways. The most annoying and, for me, prevalent is the CPU gets every possible advantage starting with the coin toss, fills out their bench with Pokémon and fully evolves at least half of their Pokémon while I’m stuck with a handful of third stage evolves only drawing the second stage when the battle is a turn from done. Things work out so perfectly it seems like there is zero chance in their card draws, pulling exactly what they need at that given time. And if your deck or their deck has cards dependent on a coin toss, forget it. They get a card like Misty and get heads all the way through. I can count on one hand the number of times a coin flip for my cards went in my favor. You meticulously create a deck for yourself trying to avoid coin toss cards and too many evolves, but even then if the CPU still gains every advantage, why bother?

Sometimes, mainly noticed on the easier battles, you get a clean sweep because the CPU avoids obvious moves, like trading out a nearly defeated Pokémon. 

It feels like CPU battles are an afterthought because instead of making it organically challenging and realistic, you either get decimated with no hope of strategy or deck building helping you to succeed or sometimes you get matches where the CPU still gains every advantage and just awkwardly seems to shuffle things around waiting for you to defeat their max evolved Pokémon. 

Coin flips should at least give some sort of illusion of there being a 50-50 chance but it’s more like 1-99. I’m no mathematical statistics expert, but that kind of seems a bit broken to me.","CPU Battles need serious balancingCPU battles need a ridiculous amount of balancing.

It takes an EX to get 150 trade points and you can trade an EX for 500 points. There shouldn’t be a rule to trade at the same rarity and only up trading gold stars. And the premium is a little overrated but over all this is a great game. You should stay away from the trading tho 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓,Jude’s reviewOkay the game is great and the arts of the cards are INSANE!

But for some reason, they’ve decided that the TRADING card game app should be near impossible to trade on. You have to have a stupid amount of trade tokens to trade most cards, which you only get by trashing very high rarity cards, or by grabbing the occasional pity gifts. On top of that, cards above 1 star rarity can’t be traded at all. Essentially, for people trying to complete their collections, extra promo, 2 star, 3 star and crown rarity cards have absolutely no value or purpose. They are just very pretty trash. Pokemon, if you care about community, you need to remember accessibility matters. If you gatekeep trading, you are denying access to an essential and fun feature of the game at its core to your player base.

US,2,2025-02-07,1.1.1,HonestThoughtsOnThis,Attention duelists,"First and foremost, there is no trading in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I’m guessing when it does get added, it will disappoint a lot of people based on how limited the F2P model is. 

Edit: Guess I was right!

This game does a good job of sucking you in at first, but it slows down quickly. 

To be clear, you can slowly build up a collection over time and get most of the cards you want. Your overall luck opening/picking cards will determine what you can battle with while building up your collection, but that luck can vary wildly. 

The game is light on content and has already resorted to repeating its first few ideas. 
It makes me wonder if this game was pushed out early to cover for delays elsewhere in the franchise. They have tons of media they could reference for ideas and they’ve chosen to do only the most basic stuff. 

Battles are a large part of the experience if you aren’t spending money to open packs. The 20 card 2 copy limit offers its own pros and cons. Because of how limited the card pool is, the competitive aspect of the game is limited as well. Most battles are won based on playing two cards. They’re the only two cards that draw more cards, and if one person plays more of them, they’re probably going to win. Luck matters in all card games, but you can really feel it in this one. The game is up front about being casual though, so maybe the high variance is how they hope to achieve that. 

Evolutions require a unique card for each stage. Getting a basic, middle, and final evolution into play in sequence is tough with the limited card pool. Basically, high variance is (almost) everywhere. This will likely get better as more trainer cards and Pokémon with abilities come out. 

Even though battling others in PVP is the majority of the content right now, only the winning player gets a reward of 15 exp (not a lot), meaning if you start losing a game or just get a bad opener it’s reasonable to just concede and try again. There is no penalty for losses. This cheapens the overall experience for both sides. I don’t think they should add a penalty, but both players should be rewarded for completing a battle.

The F2P economy is a bit stingy. Two packs a day is great as a baseline, but the game doesn’t reward you much for actually playing. Daily missions give you additional pack every 3-4 days. If you level up you get a free pack. Packs contain five cards. 

Rarity also isn’t intuitive. Three diamond cards are more rare than most EX cards because EX cards often have alternate arts. This means you have more chances to see Pickachu EX than a Magneton because there are technically three different Pickachu EX cards that could end up in your pack.

Pack Points are the biggest issue for me and why I rate the game so poorly. I would be able to ignore the aggressiveness of the monetization if I was able to craft a few important low-rarity cards I can’t seem to open. 

I would love a way to convert duplicate cards into cards that I need. Five cards per pack with no guaranteed rares (three diamond of above) means you’ll have gaps in your collection unless you have exceptional luck. The majority of packs you open will just be one and two diamond cards.

I was missing a two diamond card despite opening 40+ of the pack it was in. This means I needed to spend a week of pack points to get one uncommon. Each pack opened gives 5 points and two diamond cards cost 70 points, meaning all your free packs for about a week (2/day is 10 pack points a day). I happened to open my third copy a day later, not a great experience as a F2P. I was saving my pack points to get an EX card for my starving family. 

Here’s an example of just how stingy they are with rewards. They gave away a few free packs as part of their holiday event. These packs did not give pack points when opened. They won’t even let players get 15~ free pack points for a yearly holiday event. 

Trading could also fix this, but it isn’t in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet. I’m guessing trading will be very restricted because they stand to lose way too much money if people can complete their collection through trading. My guess is that each account will get some number of free trades and the rest will cost Pokégold. I just don’t see them letting people trade without ‘taking their cut’. 

Wonder picks are the other side of the economy and it is just engineered FOMO at its worst. Showing you that you ‘picked’ incorrectly on failed attempts is definitely a choice when there are videos showing RNG is decided on packs and picks the instant resources are spent. You can and will get lucky, but the pool of cards is already large enough that finding even the right booster pack is a challenge. This is likely meant to be a catch-up mechanic for newer players and an occasional bonus for others. 

The UI needs work as well, it’s very barebones and not well organized. There are a lot of screens involved in obtaining cards that I wish were skippable. For another example, the best way to give your friends thanks is to go to the community display and scroll to the bottom. Going into the friends list to do the same thing requires 3 taps and some loading for each account manually. Deck building UI/search is also very poorly set up. 

Overall, it’s the most polished version of Pokémon Shop I’ve played, but they really need to fix the reward structure. I think the game has potential, but right now it feels like it’s an undercooked cash cow first and a game second.","Attention duelistsFirst and foremost, there is no trading in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket yet.

With The current pity system, you get 5 pack points every time you open a pack and they value a pack at 1usd. It costs 1250 pack points to get any specific ⭐️⭐️ or RR rarity card, thats 250 packs opened or $250 A 🔸🔸🔸🔸 ex card costs 500 pack points so 100 packs. Thats essentially $100 worth of packs. I need to be able to use my duplicate 🔸🔸🔸🔸 ex cards and ⭐️ cards to exchange for higher rarity ⭐️⭐️ and RR variants to complete my set. I have 5 copies or more of practically every Ex in the game. The trading feature they implemented is essentially me giving away 100$ every time I would make a trade. Its diabolical and apple has been wiping away valid reviews. This game isnt a 4.8 star game. This game is extremely scummy to F2P and whaling isn’t efficient since you you will end up getting a duplicate ⭐️⭐️ or RR which you’re stuck with. They cant be traded. It costs like 3000-7000 usd to complete a set too I also have multiple copies of ⭐️⭐️⭐️ cards. Wish I could exchange them for ⭐️⭐️ cards",Negative

US,5,2025-02-06,1.1.0,Kai282,Fix Trading,"I love the game and idea of it. Do not get me wrong the game is pretty fun. But for a trading card game the trading feature and concept is very very lackluster and could’ve been done better especially when that was the one thing that excited most fans. When I got the update and even saw reviews online I already knew the trading feature was going to tank. The concept is there but to be honest the fact that there is a limit to what to trade and there is a cost to to it is very disappointing. At the very least having to introduce a brand new “Trade” currency when we have the Shinedust readily available with majorly users having thousands already is pretty much unnecessary. I suggest to take a good look at the trading system back during the Pokémon XY era on the 3DS where players used to nickname Pokemon to form sentences as a way of communication so a chat box feature would’ve been nice (obviously no bad words) and you can see what exactly what they are wanting to trade. Another way around this is basically a “Request Trade feature” where you can essentially let the player you are trading with know what card you want specifically. Lastly, bringing back Wonder Trade and the GTS System would be great. A Local Trade system would be nice also as it would be more efficient and easy if someone standing right in front you has the game and wants to trade. I hope you guys really consider this in the future.","Fix TradingI love the game and idea of it. Do not get me wrong the game is pretty fun.

I haven’t spent money and when playing these sort of games I tend to not have the best of luck. You get two free 5 card packs per day, but you can earn tickets to get said packs sooner (up to a certain point per month, which could use this limit to be removed since paying players have more advantages as in more card packs and special rewards in way of unique cards and cosmetics). 

Battling is pretty fun and quick. The animations give a nice touch to the match, giving you more of a sense of satisfaction seeing some moves being played. Timers are in place forcing people to make a move or a move is made for them, usually in the form of passing on their turn, allowing you to keep going and not be stuck with someone that just wants you to concede to win the match.

The one time I reached out to the support for this app, it was slow in responding and not helpful, nor understanding. Their instructions were lacking and missing some steps, enough so I mistakingly got two free premium trials on the same account instead of one on each account. After weeks the reply was that they could not do anything in order to keep the game fair.

The trading system so far in only for paying customers. Example being that in order for me to trade any board besides a common, I have to trade 5 cards of that rarity to the game for tokens to be able to trade a sixth card to my friend. Rarer cards will give back more tokens, but you will always have to give a lot more than you get in return for tokens. Thus unless you pay for packs, you will be able to trade 1 to 4 cards with the free tokens they give at the beginning, then it’s up to you to give the cards you have to be able to trade. It would have been less greedy and more friendly to free tokens play players if common cards and dust were exchangeable for tokens, example of 20 tokens per card or 20 tokens for 100 dust. But in this state it is really only intended for people that are willing to pay money.

Overall I am a happy with the new content/events that come out to keep you engaged. The gap between pay to play and free players is definitely felt a lot more in the beginning of a release, but over quite a long period of time you can earn good enough cards to be a match for the pay to play players. In essence it is a pay to win mechanic at the release of something, but over months of time you can have decks as complete/powerful as the paying players. If the paid content was purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3. I will update this review as things change in the future.

—————UPDATE—————
February 5 2025:

I would like to thank the development team for generous gift of trade tokens I received this morning!! That was an unexpected nice surprise! 

I have kept playing everyday and am enjoying the new live events. The addition of an EX available as a promo prize card is exciting and has a potential of helping towards making the new trade feature more usable for free to play players. If the rate at which EX and rarer cards is highly increased, then it definitely would be another way of tackling the trade token conversion rate problem. 
I have a slight concern in approaching the problem this way, where the overall value of the EX cards would go down due to the increased ease in getting them. Maybe a way to avoid that could be in having a non stop single player event that rewards EX level rarity cards to use specifically for exchanging for trade tokens. 
That could be an innovative way of solving the problem instead of adding trade in token value to common cards and changing the token exchange rates. Not knowing the difficulty in programming these changes in the game, I do not know which would be the cleaner way for the development team to approach this. What I do know is that a change is desperately needed to make this trade feature more realistically available for free to play players. This is not discounting that it is still not easy nor cheap for paying players! At the end of the day though this feature if easier to use for paying players due to the increased amount of cards they receive, thus creating a bigger imbalance between paying and free to play players.
If the bigger difference between paying and free play players is purposely introduced, I would suggest adding battle lobbies for just free to play players, making it more enjoyable for that community having more balanced deck opponents in relation to how many cards can be collected for free play players.

I hope the different suggestions I gave above will be seen and considered to bring back more balance between paying and free play players. Since the update I have used the trade feature to trade common cards with my friends. I haven’t traded anything requiring tokens in the hopes that someday there will be changes that will allow trading rarer cards cheaper than what is realistically only fairly doable with the tokens given for free as gifts from the developer team.

I will update the review and try to keep it shorter as things change.","A bit greedyPlayed for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun.

It also is severely limited in how many times you can do it, and requires yet another resource to initiate. Again: you have no idea what you are getting back (or if you will get anything, since the “partner” can reject the trade outright). You would be better off just buying paper cards.

It’s even worse after you spend all your hourglasses, booster pack open refresh energy, and still pull nothing but basic cards.

Also if you do pull a cool EX card you better hope you have the basic pre evolution Pokemon card, or cards, or you literally just don’t get to use that super rare cool awesome mega card you just got, feels so bad and what a slap in the face to the player. The game just feels greedy and lackluster for what it is, feels rushed and half baked. The UI is also so bad and filled with so many extra clicks to get to what you really want.

US,1,2025-02-05,1.1.0,ChocoApples,Needs Improvement,"I felt pretty excited when this game first came out. It’s nice to be able to see the nice effects from holos and EX cards. I wish that it didn’t cost so much to open packs of cards. With how many sets there are and the lack of currency you get for opening packs, I have yet to complete a single set. I think it’s a great game to check into when waking up and before going to bed. That’s about it.

The battle system is terrible. It takes 3 points for a win. If you knock out an EX card, you gain 2 points. If you knock out a regular card, you’ll be rewarded with 1 point. Most of the time, someone happens to pull an EX as their first card. It pretty much decides the game. There’s no time to try to compete. It’s even worse when the opponent has a Pokemon card that allows them to gain energy and place the energy onto whichever Pokemon. It makes it way too easy for the person to win since they get an infinite supply of energy and you don’t have a strong enough card, nor an energy generating card. I think they should require 6 points for the win to allow people time to try to make a comeback or be on an even playing field. 

I probably would only recommend this game to a child. Sure, it’ll be something they quickly become bored of but at least they’ll be in awe for a few minutes each time they open a pack of cards.","Needs ImprovementI felt pretty excited when this game first came out.

US,1,2025-02-05,1.1.0,Makccj,A Monetized Dumpster Fire,"Pokémon TCG Pocket Review: A Monetized Dumpster Fire

Let’s get one thing straight: Pokemon TCG Pocket is an Abomasnow’nation to both Pokemon fans and trading card game enthusiasts. What could have been an exciting, mobile friendly way to enjoy the Pokemon TCG is instead a soulless, money grabbing mess that strips away everything fun about collecting and battling.

Gacha Mechanics “Masquerain’ing” as a Card Game

Get it? Get it?! Any who…this game isn’t about strategy or deck building. It’s about daily pack openings with an aggressive monetization model. You don’t “collect” cards in a meaningful way. You pray to the random number generator gods and hope to Arceus you pull something decent. The odds can’t be that bad though,  right? Right? Well, you tell me. 0.050% chance you open a rare pack. You read that right. To add insult to injury-there’s no system to exchange duplicate cards for in-game currency, meaning the useless extra copies you’ll pull 99.950% of the time just sit there, mocking you. Meanwhile, in-game currency can be used to unlock cards, but there’s no direct way to work toward the ones you actually want. It’s an artificial, exploitative system designed to keep you chasing the next pack instead of building a deck you actually enjoy.

A Trading System That’s a Total Muk-up

The recent addition of a trading feature should have been a saving grace, but it’s somehow even worse than expected. Also, don’t skip past the fact that I stated trading is a recent addition. I hope they released the game as Pokemon CG at first! Anyway, instead of a simple, straightforward way to exchange cards with friends, we get a convoluted mess of “Trade Stamina” and “Trade Tokens” because God forbid we just trade cards like a normal human. It feels like the developers actively sat down and asked, How can we make this as tedious and anti consumer as possible? Seems they forgot what the T in TCG stands for. 

Watered-Down Gameplay That Insults TCG Fans

If you were hoping for deep, strategic gameplay like the physical Pokemon TCG or even Pokemon TCG Live, you’re in for a disappointment. Battles feel shallow, uninspired, and largely automated. There’s no real room for skill. It just another case of “tap the screen and hope you win.” The fact that Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel can faithfully recreate its complex card game while Pokemon delivers something that feels designed for a Slowpoke. It’s beyond embarrassing.

And it’s not just about depth. The matchmaking is a complete joke. You will be matched regularly with level 30+ players before you ever see level 10 all while under the Beginner tab. There’s no balance, no proper ranking system and a whole lot of Unown. Pure chaos. Worse yet, losing a match nets zero rewards. No points, no progress—just wasted time.

Repetitive Meta That Kills Any Variety

Even if you suffer through the awful matchmaking and dumbed-down gameplay, you’ll quickly notice that every match feels exactly the same. The same overpowered cards dominate the meta, making deck variety non-existent. If you’re not running those cards, you’re at an instant disadvantage. Combine that with the ridiculous card acquisition system, and it’s clear the game is designed to keep you grinding endlessly or spending money just to remain competitive.

Final Verdict: Stay Far Away

Pokemon TCG Pocket is everything wrong with modern mobile gaming—paywalled progression, shallow mechanics, and a deliberately broken economy that treats players like cash cows. If you’re looking for a way to enjoy the Pokemon TCG, do yourself a favor and play literally anything else. 

Score: 0/10 – A Masterclass in How to Ruin a Beloved Franchise

(Side note** How silly of me, Pokemon isn’t doing this as a cash grab! They added daily spending limits of around $140 or about $4200 a month to save you from yourself. Because 2 house mortgages a month on virtual cards isn’t too much! What clowns 🤡) also note, when you spend that $4200 a month to build the Meta deck of you’re dreams, Pokémon is within their rights to ban any card(s) straight into the sun, never to be used again, as they see fit to maintain a “fair battle environment”.","A Monetized Dumpster FirePokémon TCG Pocket Review: A Monetized Dumpster Fire

So unless you’re lucky to pull one of the full art cards you’re looking for, be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars just for the resources to buy one. Overall the game is great, but there really needs to be a way to cash in the vast amount of lower tier cards you’re going to obtain.

US,2,2025-02-05,1.1.0,TGromps,Dev’s not making changes/QoL,"Personally not a fan of apps never making request changes, especially QoL ones. Still no Dark Mode, trading can only be done if you destroy Holos/3diamond rares, ex cards, and art rare cards ( ex: one ex trade requires BOTH sides to sacrifice 20 holos each or at least four ex cards/art rares). I’ve been playing with a subscription since pretty early on and the expectation of how many duplicates needed to be sacrificed in one trade is absurd. 
Flipping coins for paralysis/status effects when the pokemon is dead/0hp, battle events are just win 5 in a row or 45 total so they’re just grinds and not very reflective of your strategy/knowledge, Profile Card Displays are shown with the card minimized outside of the Display Case as if it’s an item in a menu and NOT in any way an actual Display of the card on your profile, 15 decks can only be made which the more you battle and open packs the more you understand how awful it is, flares must be manually and individually put on every time you make your 20 card decks so you end up just not wanting to even use them, the visual card overlay flares ONLY appear for 1 second when you put your card onto the field or use its attacks/abilities (so they’re un-flared the entire match on the playmat), binder/display flares show a static image unless you click on them to ‘observe’ them up close, you can’t report other players in-game for inappropriate names (which I highly suggest as a feature in anything kids play as well), you can’t buy multiples of anything in the shop/event shops in one transaction, you have to keep buying things over and over till it’s out, only 3 of the tons (and more to come) badges can be displayed on your profile, the profile trophies only give 30-100 stardust (I have 43,500 stardust, if you ever can win 10,000 pvp matches you’re getting 100 stardust for it), can only open one promo pack at a time, once you get five shop tickets for the day any other ‘Thanks’ you get just give you a notification mark and you can collect them all but they do nothing, there are not many icons in the game so you just all sorta have the same fiveish and that heavily contributes to the lack of profile/individuality in the game (but they ARE ADDING MORE! So credit to that! Would be nice if it was just any card you had could be your profile pic!), and there’s an odd amount of small time-wasting; can’t use or do anything after using pokeball or anything that makes the deck shuffle, post game screen has three pages of odd stats that don’t really matter to either parties (including a screen that only tells you that you don’t get anything for losing) then they place the thanks button suddenly above the next button so if you’re clicking through your pages you accidentally don’t thank them and just leave the page. 

It’s a ton of these small things that in other games devs will see themselves or hear about and then fix, but this game the only thing I’ve seen slightly assessed from the devs was that THEY will handle to inappropriate names… no report button needed apparently, yet I still run into them… I’m not sure why at bare minimum dark mode isn’t here.. Games where developers are like this are just soul-less to me, with the saving grace being the beautiful card illustrations. Clearly, with how much profits they made within the first DAY of this games release, they don’t seem to care. The less you care about this game the better; just log on, get your free packs, and close it.","Dev’s not making changes/QoLPersonally not a fan of apps never making request changes, especially QoL ones. Still no Dark Mode, trading can only be done if you destroy Holos/3diamond rares, ex cards, and art rare cards ( ex: one ex trade requires BOTH sides to sacrifice 20 holos each or at least four ex cards/art rares). I’ve been playing with a subscription since pretty early on and the expectation of how many duplicates needed to be sacrificed in one trade is absurd. 
Flipping coins for paralysis/status effects when the pokemon is dead/0hp, battle events are just win 5 in a row or 45 total so they’re just grinds and not very reflective of your strategy/knowledge, Profile Card Displays are shown with the card minimized outside of the Display Case as if it’s an item in a menu and NOT in any way an actual Display of the card on your profile, 15 decks can only be made which the more you battle and open packs the more you understand how awful it is, flares must be manually and individually put on every time you make your 20 card decks so you end up just not wanting to even use them, the visual card overlay flares ONLY appear for 1 second when you put your card onto the field or use its attacks/abilities (so they’re un-flared the entire match on the playmat), binder/display flares show a static image unless you click on them to ‘observe’ them up close, you can’t report other players in-game for inappropriate names (which I highly suggest as a feature in anything kids play as well), you can’t buy multiples of anything in the shop/event shops in one transaction, you have to keep buying things over and over till it’s out, only 3 of the tons (and more to come) badges can be displayed on your profile, the profile trophies only give 30-100 stardust (I have 43,500 stardust, if you ever can win 10,000 pvp matches you’re getting 100 stardust for it), can only open one promo pack at a time, once you get five shop tickets for the day any other ‘Thanks’ you get just give you a notification mark and you can collect them all but they do nothing, there are not many icons in the game so you just all sorta have the same fiveish and that heavily contributes to the lack of profile/individuality in the game (but they ARE ADDING MORE!

US,3,2025-02-05,1.1.0,OverlyVerbose1,New trade system is abysmal,"The trade system is godawful. It’s somehow both too expensive for normal players and too restrictive for those who splash large amounts of money on the game. The conversion rate on the trade currency means that, unless you only want to trade commons that pretty much everyone already has, you have to have a whale-like amount of rares to throw away. But that itself is an issue, since if you have that many rares, you most likely have every card and would have no use for trading (this is made worse by the fact that the very rare cards that whales would trade for can’t be traded). It’s a system that has an identity crisis. It can’t help casual players fill out their decklists and it can’t help whales hunt down the rare cards they don’t yet have. Which leads to the obvious question: who *is* it for? *edit: apparently they’re “continuing to consider the possibility of improving the trading function,” as stated on their social media (as translated from Japanese, so may not be their exact wording), and in the meantime they’ve gifted 1000 trade tokens, or about two EX/star trades, to go along with the previous 500 token gift. Not to sound like a miser, but this gift and/or fix seems… a little anemic. Hopefully it’s a sign that they’re going to adjust prices to be less absurd, but I’m not holding my breath on that front.","New trade system is abysmalThe trade system is godawful.

TLDR: this game is a money grab for nostalgic millennials. It’s too slow, and too biased towards exorbitantly expensive pay-to-play, and the game odds are manipulated. 

Additions: 

Changed to 1 star because the in-game purchases are predatory. If you spend real money to get gold, the gold cost of “ten packs” will increase, forcing you to purchase more to try and afford it. Not okay. 

The versus battling has nothing to help casual players. There are 2-3 toxic deck strategies that are used by the majority of players online, making battling extremely un-fun and difficult to progress, which is painful because versus is the only way to consistently gain experience points and progress. 

Trading is completely unusable. The barrier of entry is so high, that the average player can only afford to do a few trades period. 

The booster pack pull rate odds are manipulated. They boost them at random times to get you addicted pull them back to get you to pay for more packs. 

—-
Let me start out by saying I absolutely adore this game. I will be a player for the foreseeable future.

That said, the reward system needs rebalancing, and the coin flip odds are not 50/50. 

First, many of the rewards you receive can only be exchanged for things that don’t help you advance in the game. Second, there are many things that do not give you experience that logically should, making it difficult to progress. Third, there are not enough ways to earn pack hourglasses after you reach a certain point in the game. I used to be able to open 5–6 packs per day, now I can only open the one or two given each day because I have cleared all of the solo battles that give pack hourglasses.

On the coin flip subject, certain cards appear to have different odds. Additionally, the very first coin flip dramatically influences the rest of your results. If you get heads first, you often get mostly heads. If you get tails first, often times you get all tails. Very irritating.","Highly Irritating, and riggedOriginal review below.

The Bad: Boy oh boy this game just wants to bleed your wallet dry. The leveling system is fast at first but eventually will become a slow grind. Especially because of the small exp you earn per battle. Why would anyone want to play a game that requires more work and less reward. The trading system is also very awful! Aside from locking the rarest cards available for trading… the cost of trading a card is also ridiculous. For example: It costs 500 trade tokens to trade 1 EX card. To earn trade tokens you would need to exchange some cards… since Commons and Uncommons have no value, you can’t exchange those for trade tokens, instead you have to exchange your rares and 1 star cards. 1 Star cards can earn you 125 trade tokens. You need 500 to trade one 1-Star cards. You basically need to exchange four 1-star cards to be able to trade for one! Never mind the fact that you also need duplicates to obtain Flairs. The premium pass is also overly priced. For $10 monthly subscription… you get a premium promo card and about 5 cosmetic items and an extra pack per day. For those wanting to complete their card sets… this is a burn in your pocket. You are pretty much spending $10 on 1 digital promo card… while the extra pack can gain you cards you can normally get during regular play and it’s not even guaranteed you will get super rares. For a “gatcha” game… it’s not worth it. At least it’s not worth it for what they are offering right now.

The game is fun, you open packs and get your favorite Pokemon and it can be done for free, with the option to buy gold to get the cards that you need faster. That said, the trading system it’s very punishing and unbalanced. You need to get rid of several valuable cards just to get one of the same value. This, instead of rewarding the players that spend time in the game, pushes the users to spend even more money, so they can get more cards to trade for tokens. The only solution I see is to update the trade tokens system so they can be obtained easier. Otherwise, I really think that governments should regulate companies that deliberately force gambling to its users.","Fun & Engaging. But trading needs to be improvedAs many people pointed out.

Especially since the materials are finite and only avalible through one-time accomplishments, I don’t see a current life beyond a year of there’s nothing done about it. And if there is changes, players should be compensated for playing the game in what would have been a worst state. There’s potential here to be a truly fun game but whoever designed the currency system ensured it’s some of the most cutthroat Mobile game shenanigans you can expect on the market. Expected from Game Freak anymore I guess to charge more for less. I garentee unless you spend money on the game, you’ll find yourself playing the game for only minutes at a time each day, if you don’t get bored from obtaining mostly common pulls from each pack.",Neutral

Small spenders and free to play players might not even have that many copies laying around and doing nothing and on top of it, you cannot even trade for the newest cards which are the cards that the small spenders and free to players might actually want to trade for.

Dailies: we need more daily activities to entice us to open the app beyond just a free pull or two. How about a new challenge every day with a pull as the reward?

It could be a goal in battles or a deck that somebody at HQ put together that we have to beat. It would take you guys three seconds to make a competitive deck that people could view as a challenge.

Rewards for online play: 15 XP is a ridiculous reward for beating someone that could range from completely incompetent to incredibly good at the game. 

How about we add skill based matchmaking? Better players are rewarded more? 

Better trading system: the current trading system is asinine and easily the worst part of the game as it currently stands. There is no way to tell what somebody is willing to trade for or what they even are willing to trade at all. You can only trade with friends. I don’t wanna have to go onto the Reddit trading megathread to trade my Pokémon.

US,1,2025-02-03,1.1.0,Jadon2468,"Love the game, but the cash grab tactics are just sad","*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention * 

I dont know if the developers will actually read this but I hope they will. I absolutely love this game and have played it daily for months. However there are a few greedy tactics used by the developers in order to encourage spending money that I think should be changed or reworked.

The first in irritation and most obvious is the fact that you can’t open 10 packs with a free pack available. I think this is unnecessarily slimy from the developers side. I don’t want to always only use my hourglasses or gold when opening 10 packs, especially when I am saving for a new set that is coming out. The game is going to make great money either way, so I feel like its extra to not allow the player to choose what kind of currency is used for opening a pack. (Its currently always the free ones first). 

The second is the limit on hour glass purchases. I understand why this one is somewhat necessary from a bottom line standpoint, although I think its taken to the extreme. You can earn shop tickets through playing the game to use to purchase hourglasses from the shop, but only in a limited amount that gets refreshed monthly. However there is also a limit on the amount of shop tickets you can earn in a day. The fact that the developers felt the need to limit both how many hourglasses you can buy and also how many daily tickets you can earn is ridiculous. Limiting one is understandable, limiting both is cruel and greedy. Every month I purchase all of the hourglasses possible almost as soon it refreshes. But it still takes almost the whole previous months worth of work to earn those shop tickets to be able to buy the hour glasses in the first place. I dont understand the need for a limit on both especially considering how harsh each limit is.

There are more, but this is already quite long and those two are the most glaring. Most of my friends have quit playing this game because of one or both of these tactics. Does the slight amount of extra money gained through these tactics really outweigh the discontent and annoyance felt by the playerbase? I doubt it, and I bet player retention would sky rocket if these were changed.","Love the game, but the cash grab tactics are just sad*leaving a one star to hopefully get the developers attention *

US,3,2025-02-02,1.1.0,Bacelight,Review on versus battles,"Pokémon TCG is a fun game, but the versus battles feel unbalanced. At level 20, I’m constantly matched against opponents who are 10+ levels higher, making it difficult to compete. The XP system is also frustrating—you only get 15 XP for a win, nothing for a loss, and there’s no real incentive to keep playing. The matchmaking doesn’t seem to prioritize skill level, and the rewards don’t feel proportional to the effort put in. Overall, it feels pay-to-win, and I’d appreciate a fairer system that offers better matchmaking, more XP per battle, and some form of reward for participation.
Otherwise, thank you for this great game.","Review on versus battlesPokémon TCG is a fun game, but the versus battles feel unbalanced.

I can literally hit the concede button in the menus from 2-4 times, each time needing to navigate to it by the time the game gets you of the match.

They say the odds are a coin flip every time, but really they have set numbers underneath to make sure you have worse odds. Border line illegal tbh. Nintendo/Pokemon still in 2025 do not understand the market, choosing to ride the wave as the most popular franchise of all time, leading to poor user experiences just to get what little fun they can out because it’s the new “official” Pokemon thing.

It’s incredibly disappointing to invest this much into the game, only to be locked out of reasonable trades. If I’m putting my money into your system, why not at least allow a way to exchange gold cards for packet points? That would give players a fair way to obtain cards they’re missing without feeling completely restricted by an arbitrary trading system.

I enjoy the game, but this system makes it feel unfairly paywalled.

it’s a stretch to actually press those without having to toss the phone around or re-adjust with the opposing hand to be able to reach that side of the screen.

So much better than other games of its type. So much better in fact that I actually subscribed to the monthly pay card since it felt worth it to support the direction it looked like they were going. 

Fast forward to the newest set that just released. Saved enough hourglasses to open 70 packs on release date. Out of those 70 packs, I pulled a single EX card. Just one.

Combine that with the trading system they just introduced that expects you to throw away STACKS of good cards to trade a single card with someone.

Game started out so great. Now I’ve cancelled my monthly card and will likely uninstall soon. Shame they got so greedy so quickly.

As a 30-something adult this game takes me back to my days in the late 90’s opening Jungle boosters at the game shop!

While player levels 1-15 quickly load you up with booster packs and cards to build your deck+collection, after that things really slow down. This is about the time new players will give-in and start to spend real money if they want to scratch the inevitable booster pack “itch” that can’t be scratched by the daily reset or level up rewards.

Still, there’s enough to do here that I’ll be coming back for 15-20 minutes a day to enjoy opening a free booster, snagging a Wonder pick, and jumping into a few battles. Battling is fun as well, but I wonder how quickly things will change once players are loaded up with EX cards and a meta is established.

This feature was what I was looking forward to the whole time and it&#39;s just pure buttsauce. I might quit.",Negative

US,1,2025-02-01,1.1.0,Tmacattack1998625,Not complete,"This game was initially great and ide honestly give it a much better rating if it were a complete game. As it is, it becomes very repetitive and boring quickly. I gave it a much longer try then other games due to the brand power of Pokémon, however, without trading all you can do is open 2 packs a day of the same duplicate cards. There’s no way to get new cards or the cards you need to complete sets without just randomly opening 2 packs a day. It’s a great model but when you realize they aren’t opening up trading and the only other way is to spend money on gold. Until there are more goals to complete to let you open packs or get the cards you specifically need, it just looks like a boring money grab after a day or 2.

Edit: trading is such a mess up, I’m almost in shock. I thought with the addition of trading my review would change to more positivity. The system for trading is without a doubt the worst I’ve ever seen. The whole point of being able to trade is to complete your collection but it’s just another lottery system that encourages irresponsible spending habits. I understand the goal of an app is to make money, however for a company such as Pokémon(who is not hurting in any way) to encourage such poor habits through underhanded tactics is outright shameful.","Not completeThis game was initially great and ide honestly give it a much better rating if it were a complete game.

US,3,2025-02-01,1.1.0,tonio6000,A bit greedy,"Played for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun. I haven’t spent money and when playing these sort of games I tend to not have the best of luck. You get two free 5 card packs per day, but you can earn tickets to get said packs sooner (up to a certain point per month, which could use this limit to be removed since paying players have more advantages as in more card packs and special rewards in way of unique cards and cosmetics). 

Battling is pretty fun and quick. The animations give a nice touch to the match, giving you more of a sense of satisfaction seeing some moves being played. Timers are in place forcing people to make a move or a move is made for them, usually in the form of passing on their turn, allowing you to keep going and not be stuck with someone that just wants you to concede to win the match.

The one time I reached out to the support for this app, it was slow in responding and not helpful, nor understanding. Their instructions were lacking and missing some steps, enough so I mistakingly got two free premium trials on the same account instead of one on each account. After weeks the reply was that they could not do anything in order to keep the game fair.

The trading system so far in only for paying customers. Example being that in order for me to trade any board besides a common, I have to trade 5 cards of that rarity to the game for tokens to be able to trade a sixth card to my friend. Rarer cards will give back more tokens, but you will always have to give a lot more than you get in return for tokens. Thus unless you pay for packs, you will be able to trade 1 to 4 cards with the free tokens they give at the beginning, then it’s up to you to give the cards you have to be able to trade. It would have been less greedy and more friendly to free tokens play players if common cards and dust were exchangeable for tokens, example of 20 tokens per card or 20 tokens for 100 dust. But in this state it is really only intended for people that are willing to pay money.

Overall I am a happy with the new content/events that come out to keep you engaged. The gap between pay to play and free players is definitely felt a lot more in the beginning of a release, but over quite a long period of time you can earn good enough cards to be a match for the pay to play players. In essence it is a pay to win mechanic at the release of something, but over months of time you can have decks as complete/powerful as the paying players. If the paid content for purely for cosmetic items, then I would rate this game a 5, but as it stands, with the advantages the paywall provides, I can only give it a 3. I will update this review as things change in the future.","A bit greedyPlayed for a few months now and so far have found it fairly fun.

I would much rather be able to show what I am looking for, or at least for there to be prompts letting me know if the card I picked is a card that friend does not own. I haven&#39;t been using the feature due to this. For example, I have most of the Genetic Apex pack filled out, but never pulled a Gardevoir card. It would be nice if I could just say that that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for on my trade profile.

Let me explain some of that wonderful new features for you before you download or buy: you cannot trade high rarity or promo cards at all (something that is at least understandable but imo not good) / if you are free to play then you will probably never have enough cards to trade for currency to trade in the first place / oh yeah for the basic cards that are free to trade because they are so common, yeah you can’t trade anything from the new expansion which is the only cards most people would be trading anyways at that rarity. Now throw in the fact that the meta game is completely defined by expansion cards as in you are at a clear disadvantage without them and you can clearly see that this new trading system is a sign on what direction this game is trending in.

This all is coming from someone who has bought some gold before and who pays for the monthly premium, I would go so far as to say if the devs would have just chose not to add a trading system it would have been better for the game overall.","Pay 2 WinThis game added a trading feature a few days ago, and it is terrible. Let me explain some of that wonderful new features for you before you download or buy: you cannot trade high rarity or promo cards at all (something that is at least understandable but imo not good) / if you are free to play then you will probably never have enough cards to trade for currency to trade in the first place / oh yeah for the basic cards that are free to trade because they are so common, yeah you can’t trade anything from the new expansion which is the only cards most people would be trading anyways at that rarity. Now throw in the fact that the meta game is completely defined by expansion cards as in you are at a clear disadvantage without them and you can clearly see that this new trading system is a sign on what direction this game is trending in.

US,2,2025-02-01,1.1.0,saul207,Rigged for people willing to pay,"I’ve been playing this game since November and while there’s a lot that can be fixed the battling is fun nonetheless. My problem is that as of recently my card pulls are nonexistent. The difference between an account who puts money in it and an account who plays for free is astronomical when it comes to pack pulls. And with the new Dialga and palkia booster packs, I’ve opened 13 so far and I have yet to get any cards of rarity. I go on YouTube and see players who spend money on the game (this is obvious due to all the paid gold they use) and within their first 10 packs they’ve got enough decent pulls to even create a new deck. I’d also like to mention, why? Why rig the wonder pick? My cousin who is the only person I have in my friends list from real life, has pulled 2 God packs, and never once was a I able to wonder pick any of them. In fact you guys give me his worst packs, a wonder pick with no rarities. I even remember when he pulled his second God pack, I told him not to open another pack to see if I can wonder pick, and guess what? His God pack never showed up, and when his wonder pick did, it was a normal pack with (once again) nonexistent rarity. If I don’t pull something by the end of this week I don’t think I’m gonna bother collecting cards and playing anymore. Way too rigged in my opinion.","Rigged for people willing to payI’ve been playing this game since November and while there’s a lot that can be fixed the battling is fun nonetheless.

I’ve been a season pass customer since launch and have been having a blast collecting all of the cards, building decks, and battling other trainers. The game is genuinely fun for me. 

I was looking forward to the trading feature since launch, since I would be able to trade some of my duplicate cards for ones I don’t have with my friends, and vise-versa. Pretty straight forward. 

After seeing how severely restricted trading is after being implemented, I have canceled my season pass, and won’t be a paying customer until trading is changed. 

Being unable to trade newer cards is one thing, but requiring so many resources to do any trades at all seems anti-fun and a bit mean spirited. It seems like the game devs Frankenstein’d a crafting system into a trading system and the result isn’t pretty.
