US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,I Play TCG Pocket EVERY DAY,This game is really fun and addictive!,This game got me really into the Pok√©mon TCG and made opening packs more accessible to me and you should download it. (Also check out Pok√©mon go)
US,3,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Rico Swahvay,Really Random? Please‚Ä¶,"Fun game when you play all solo levels until you get to the expert level. Your Programming intentionally waits to draw all needed cards toward the end of the deck when I need them. I understand needing to raise the difficulty, but keep the player‚Äôs deck actually random, and you can continue to manipulate the opponents deck for it to reach their evolutions right away as usual üòÇ. I should really give this game 2 stars, but I like pokemon. Furthermore, the autoplay feature will purposely avoid making the obvious move for us to cause us to basically lose a turn, for example: attaching a much-needed energy to a bench pokemon instead of the active, which would fill the required amount of energy needed to make an attack. Again, I understand raising difficulty, but come on get real! How about this: stacking our hand with nothing but duplicate stage 2 pokemon, and one basic to start? There are no odds where that should be happening. Before you assume my decks, they are well-balanced and strategic. But what good is strategy if your algorithm constantly sabotages? Do you want return users or not?"
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Ice104621,One of those special games,Such a great game love the idea that you can get cards digitally and trade with your friends and other people battle with them it‚Äôs just overall such a great game many of my friends playlist and so do I expecting lots of updates to great game
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Conner. It‚Äôs my real name,Fun,Fun fun fun fun fun fun ü§™ü§™üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´
US,2,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Dude weather,Pay to play,"The game is fun but there‚Äôs no point in playing if you don‚Äôt want to spend money, pull rates on getting good cards are about 1 and 100 packs unless you pay‚Ä¶ there also needs to be skill based matchmaking, based on deck build and skill level. It‚Äôs not fair to constantly get matched with people that buy the best cards."
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,fckubiches,They delete bad reviews,1-15 in pvp is clear that it‚Äôs staged. Cards are broken and u won‚Äôt update them. Ur development only cares for money for a small basic game. Crack ain‚Äôt cheap
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,YOSavageryLO,This game is absolutely garbage!,"Thanks developers for stealing a rainbow card from my wonderpicks for the fourth time now making me waste over 200 over your worthless hour glasses! Seriously thanks so much, also maybe considering fixing your useless trading system that‚Äôd be great."
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,WhiteBoyRodman,Where to start..,"Loved this game for the first 3-5 days; didn‚Äôt realize that the odds were temporarily a lot higher for EVERYTHING for the first 3 days, until I experienced the next 30-60. It‚Äôs been that long since I pulled an EX from a wonder pick, or a showcase card for any deck. I‚Äôve won a TON of battle, but with 12 and 14 coin flips, I get ALL TAILS more often than any other outcome. Lol 0/12 repeatedly in one match isn‚Äôt real AT ALL. Odds are fake and stacked in favor of getting u into the game, then never again. Canceling that premium subscription ASAP. 140+ wonder picks with not one EX isn‚Äôt just me or bad luck. lol they just show u whatever card they want y to have regardless of what card u pick. Fakest odds I‚Äôve seen since MyTeam in NBA 2K this game must be owned by Take Two Interactive like all other trash odds games."
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,jydcjiudcj,Abilities,"You should not be able to use a Pok√©mon‚Äôs ability more than once per turn. For example, an opponent should not be able to place a Palkia down and then use Vaporeon‚Äôs ‚Äòwash out‚Äô ability 4 times in one turn to generate 4 energy."
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,emd m&m,I LOVE THIS APP,It is so fun and I love collecting all different types and types of Pok√©mon it is so cool 5 stars
US,3,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Aurelienthelion,"Has the potential to be a great card game, but..","It‚Äôs a good game; it has so much potential to be the best card game on the App Store, however there are some pretty major flaws.

1. The ‚Äúevents‚Äù are really just the same things over and over. They‚Äôre not adding anything new, just recycling the same thing, with slightly different ‚Äúrewards‚Äù every time. It makes the game seem very stale after a few months playing. 
2. Corporate greed. It‚Äôs not a rewarding game at all. There are no free stuff that the devs periodically give to players, like 99.99% of other free games on the App Store do. Didn‚Äôt do anything for Christmas, nada. You don‚Äôt really get anything besides the extremely limited free resources from missions and events. You get 2 packs a day and that‚Äôs it. 
3. The trading system. It really only benefits people who have multiple accounts and want to trade between those accounts. Why not make it so that we can offer a card, list what we want to exchange it for, and whoever wants to accept the deal, whether on your friends list or not, can accept? Even a global mystery trade option would be really cool, and definitely feasible for you guys. But right now, the trading system is completely useless if you have only one account, or if you don‚Äôt have friends who play the game. 

I don‚Äôt know if the devs are just lazy, or if they just don‚Äôt really care about the game‚Äôs longevity because they‚Äôre making so much money right now, but as of lately, the game just seems like a scheme to make a quick buck off players, without ever adding anything new or trying to make the game better."

US,2,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Echoplex25,Terrible and RNG focused,"Yes it‚Äôs a card game. And card games are inherently RNG, that‚Äôs already a bad thing but to stack even more things on it like a stupid coin flip gimmick that‚Äôs out of your control is outright stupid. Not to mention meta decks rule the game, you can‚Äôt do any deck you want since you‚Äôll just get stomped completely. And to add on to this, dual energies is absolutely terrible despite the game encouraging you with multiple Pok√©mon. At least the cards look nice but there‚Äôs no real
Reason to spend money on this game when you barely get any cards anyways. And stop deleting negative reviews"
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Jimmyetue,Hello,I love this game. I love this game in my whole entire world. Thank you. Goodbye.
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,LoveByGojo,Fun,Super easy and fun
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Sneaklink,Great Game idea,It‚Äôs a perfect game maybe add a win streak and allowing all trades. in my opinion the battles a bit boring maybe emotes to taunt your opponent. The pack opening is kinda sad but realistic in the real world we are forced to buy packs. in game they give you some for free I appreciate it and wouldn‚Äôt complain but really all the fun gone after 2 days make it a little easier to get your glasses or events that give you at least 10
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Unkn0wn_Lynn,So Good!!,I recently got signed out of Pok√©mon go and forgot my password but when this game came out I forgot about Pokemon Go and started playing this!!
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,KGenuineReviews,Pok√©mon Travesty Card Game,"Pocket successfully turns something you love into a great source of sadness with its terrible pull rates. It provides no methods for improving your chances of getting the cards that would bring you happiness. If The Pok√©mon Company thinks they exercises fair and acceptable practices through their operation of this app, I will cease supporting all of their products and merchandise moving forward. Pok√©mon doesn‚Äôt feel the same with this level of greed and corruption overflowing from their agenda."

US,3,2025-02-24,1.1.2,User13780,Auto battle,"Don‚Äôt use the auto battle option if you don‚Äôt want to rage quit, it plays with the skill level of a rock. Aside from that the games alright."
US,5,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Mr-Beast_bot,LOVINGGG,"LOVE LOVE LOVEE THIS GAME. even giving my boy pidgeot the love he deserves, including pidgey and pidgeotto. being able to collect cards that i love without having to pay up to $10 a pack is amazing. i also never knew exactly how to battle until now, which is a big plus. overall, best Pok√©mon game ive ever played"
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Joshie boy3000,Battles are rigged!!,None of the battles are fair and the matches they put you in don‚Äôt match you‚Äôr skill level so each game is inconsistent. Also has a pay to win system so if you don‚Äôt put money in the game don‚Äôt expect to win any games.
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,HaleStromm,All that progress!!!,"Idk what happened but all of my Pok√©mon are gone! All the cards, started me completely from beginning. Don‚Äôt play"

US,2,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Manupulado,Manipulado,"El juego tiene serios problemas en el azar que entrega. La √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n es p√©sima, le entrega una cantidad morbosa de facultades y facilidades al oponente, para lograr una victoria. No es posible que tuviera que enfrentar a la computadora 9 veces sin ganar. Utilizo el mismo set de cartas de antes,  usando esa configuraci√≥n mo hab√≠a problemas. Pero ahora, el azar de la cartas es terrible, manipulado, p√©simo. 
Estoy decepcionado de la √∫ltimos arreglos que han hecho‚Ä¶"
US,3,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Paulisonfire,Neat but Overly Dumbed Down Mechanics,"The presentation and the overall card collecting experience is really well done here! That said, this version of the trading card game has been simplified to the point where I think it&#39;s a chore to play. The original Pokemon trading card game isn&#39;t particularly complicated, so I don&#39;t know why they felt the need to simplify it even more for this version, but I don&#39;t personally feel there&#39;s enough depth left here to warrant what looks to be a really big time sink. If you just want to collect digital Pokemon cards you&#39;ll definitely enjoy this, but if you&#39;re a fan of the original card game you might find this version of it to be a bit bland."
US,4,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Emmecc929,One of the best games ever,"This in Pok√©mon GO are my two favorite apps on my phone but I do think like that other person that the trading system needs to be updated if somebody trades a couple E exes for maybe one other rarity card they can do that Also, you should change the fact that we can‚Äôt trade Pacific cards. All I need is this tokens that let you do it every once in a while. None of that other stuff you have to use to trade otherwise the game is very good. I love how you make it so there‚Äôs different kinds of packs and we don‚Äôt to do one also I think we should be thankful that we don‚Äôt have card set before we get to open other packs because if that was true, I would still be on genetics Apex lol good game but you should make it so you don‚Äôt have to wait as long to open packs as the impatient person I am I basically just play Pok√©mon GO all day and wait for my packs lol"
US,1,2025-02-24,1.1.2,sluglovers,Trading Ruined the Game,"To trade an EX, you and the person you trade with both need to destroy 5 other EXs. This makes trading nearly impossible and is really unfortunate."
US,3,2025-02-24,1.1.2,Damagedorange,It‚Äôs Okay,If you go first you are at a severe disadvantage. They should make it so you can attach energy but not attack if you go first.

US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Adrisanros21,Again Pocket is AIDS,"I cannot comprehend how they made a more basic version of TCG but it‚Äôs much worse.
First, the coin is unrealistic there is a greater chance for it to be tails than heads, plus it‚Äôs more probable for it to be double tails than double heads or one head and one tails.
Second, there is no way to go through a players deck, so if you have a crucial card at the bottom of the deck it‚Äôs a sure loss.
Third, the game is all luck based, while TCG is luck base at least in TCG you can make your own luck not like this game.
I can plead all I want but this game won‚Äôt change, so at this point it should only be played to collect cards because if you wanna battle better to play TCG"

US,4,2025-02-23,1.1.2,jbamoose,Fun nostalgia but pvp gets boring,"I enjoy the collectors aspect of this game and the deck building. However, the game doesn‚Äôt have much to accomplish beyond this as the pvp gets boiled down to who draws their Sabrina and/or Cyrus first to cheese out the easy kills. Think tiered play or limits on typing would be a fun way to spin the battles portion"
US,4,2025-02-23,1.1.2,papawsmurf,Good but,WE NEED MORE DECK SLOTS. You keep adding more cards making more decks viable so WHY are there only 15 slots for decks????
US,5,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Pro gamer5689,Really fun but‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm a really big fan of Pok√©mon games and the anime I even have a big collection of Pok√©mon tcg cards myself but I really think they should make it so the ex cards a bit better because in the real tcg ex Pok√©mon are super duper strong but since this game is like the simplified version of the real game I think you should only make them just a bit better and make so that decks can have more cards but put a limit so that each deck only can have 2 ex cards and also I would like to see some more variety‚Äôs of cards and maybe add an update so that achievements could give you certain card depending on how hard the task is anyways in conclusion it‚Äôs a great game that could use some slight changes.
US,3,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Garchomp‚Ä¶,Trade,This game is a lot of fun but the trading is really stupid because I am able to trade 2 cards with the same rarity but I have 5 different cards with the same rarity and I am not able to trade and I feel like you should just be able to trade whatever you want with no restrictions because if the trade is unfair they you can cancel it.
US,5,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Ahdoamwmannw,Yessir,"I‚Äôve had a lot of fun playing this game and pulled some heat, but some features need to be balanced, and the whole game feels catered towards people who spend money rather than those who grind the game. I wish they would add ftp reward systems"
US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Ggbjaxnydchtd,Trash,Battling is this game is literally a game of luck and whenever you‚Äôre on a losing streak the game always gives you the worst cards possible to make you continue playing absolutely dogwater
US,2,2025-02-23,1.1.2,mattatouille_x,Game RNG is Whack,"On battles where you could possibly win even if you had the odds of getting 4/10, you lose.  RNG?  It‚Äôs happened like 8x in a row.  That‚Äôs not just poor RNG, that‚Äôs horrible.  Game is betting that you lose even if you have a 50% chance at a coin toss, it‚Äôs basically a 2/10 ratio.  Horrible RNG, I have better luck gambling for the one million dollar prize at my local gas station."
US,5,2025-02-23,1.1.2,lame a** game,My 5 star rate is a lie,"The ‚Äúrng‚Äù is not rng, pretty much all my games I lose because I can never get the cards I need in my deck while the opponent gets all their cards either at the start of the match or by the fifth turn. Also every coin flip I get is always tails while my opponent always gets heads and gets multiple heads."
US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Trustinhhgyvg,Trash game,Game is trash you have to spend real money to get anything good and its still a gamble. Should be taken off the app store.
US,4,2025-02-23,1.1.2,xMadMatx,"Fun, has game issues","This game is really fun, especially as a pok√©mon fan. Collecting cards, battling with different decks. The only issues is in certain games, for example, a pok√©mon could get tails and they aren‚Äôt suppose to attack but the attack still happens. The card that makes you pull a random STARTER, pulls a 2nd evolution. And some damage does extra damage just to make the player lose even though it doesn‚Äôt have the advantage AND my pok√©mon is not even in finishing range."
US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Perfect crashing game,If you can‚Äôt pay you can‚Äôt play.,"Unless you are wealthy or a content creator, you can‚Äôt play this game. Free to play, the average person or kids will be unable to play the card game against the players that are able to spend hundreds on cards and decks. Once again The Pokemon Company International has promoted wealth and cash flow over allowing players to be allowed to play the game. Good Luck. Pok√©mon Company International just lost a life long fan and my kids who were getting into it for life. I know this won‚Äôt affect them or the people that will be dooped into playing this but just a warning. They should be ashamed of what they‚Äôve turned Pok√©mon into."

US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,Marc_Tran,Great to trash,"Everything started out great and I even subscribed. But after the recent update, it was as if they rigged it so that you can‚Äôt get any rares without paying more money. I saved up over 4√ó10 pulls plus daily free packs and sub packs, but still have not gotten a single rare (3star+)

Update: After saving up again and doing 2x10 pulls (premium included) and doing daily opens, this is absolutely frustrating. I am canceling my premium now along with everyone else. It‚Äôs clear they rigged this because the drop rates are massively different with this new update. Trading is horrendous as well. Greedy company."
US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,i love legoess,Doesn‚Äôt work at all,You need to fix this it won‚Äôt even let me in the game it keeps saying it need to reset but when I do that the same thing just happens over and over again please fix this so I can actually play this please.

US,1,2025-02-23,1.1.2,World championnnnn,Trading system is insultingly bad,"the trade system is nothing but a disgrace in this game. it costs 2 different in game currencies + a card of equal rarity. 

1 currency reloads over time. that‚Äôs fine. that‚Äôs enough. you have to limit trades somehow &amp; THAT IS ENOUGH. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE IT SHOULD COST. 

instead, the game forces you to destroy your own collection for the 2nd currency. the game FORCES you to DESTROY your OWN CARDS. just to trade to friends. 

and maybe you think it‚Äôs just the bad cards you have a lot of. NO. ITS ALL YOUR BEST ARTS ONLY. it‚Äôs all your EX cards. that‚Äôs all you can destroy to create the 2nd currency needed to trade. nothing else. 

and maybe destroying 1 really good card gives you enough of that currency to make dozens of trades? NO. THEY HATE YOU. THEY HATE THEIR USERS. 

DESTROYING your BEST CARD will only get you 25% of the currency you need to make 1 SINGULAR TRADE. 

Uninstall. complete incompetence."

There are 0 fire types with any ability; darkness and metal has 0 representation, poison types can‚Äôt even work together. We need more Pok√©mon being able to self sustain itself in any deck their in. Like Magnetons ability.
