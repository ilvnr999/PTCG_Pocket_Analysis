"US","3","2025-03-25","1.1.2","JadedUnikitty","Love this game‚Ä¶. But","I love this game! Love the idea that it brings the card collecting Pokemon Community together‚Ä¶ but on think I have noticed that seems to be an issue and that will cause new people to not want to play is if you haven been playing this game since it started and you start battling other people‚Ä¶. There is a selection for beginners and experienced players when it comes to the PVP which I can tell would be problematic since level 44 players can go in to the beginner pvp with a very well built deck. I‚Äôm a level 24 and have a well built deck‚Ä¶ my suggestion is to make a equal level pvp.. or atleast make it to were certain levels can‚Äôt select Beginner in PvP that way new people atleast have a chance."

"US","1","2025-03-25","1.1.2","Darkbladeres","Horrible pull rates","I‚Äôve been playing this game since Beta and I‚Äôm now sad. They must‚Äôve lowered the odds for better cards because for the past month I have pulled only duds. I just don‚Äôt get it. You can‚Äôt even trade the good cards anyways so why lower it. If it doesn‚Äôt get better, I can‚Äôt recommended it sadly."
"US","5","2025-03-25","1.1.2","Hatch82","So satisfying!","I downloaded this after it released but took a while to play it because I thought, oh well it‚Äôs just digital Pok√©mon cards and probably has heavy pay walls. Wow was I wrong! This is actually a very fun game!

I never thought opening packs of cards on here would be so satisfying. The card art look so good. The high level cards have a 3D effect. The menu and music is also well made. This game makes collecting cards really fun. There‚Äôs also battle mode too.

As for the ‚Äúpay wall‚Äù, which it‚Äôs not, the only thing I saw is a Gold Membership subscription which is strictly optional and doesn‚Äôt make/break gameplay. It just helps you get more stuff faster. You get cards and loot from completing missions. So no, this game does NOT harass you to spend money."

And there‚Äôs  no way of being able to get hour glasses after completing the solo games it‚Äôs sad every new game is money hungry and I opened like 20 packs and got nothing but dupes after dupes I got 1 ex and it was one I already had so how about instead of giving us dupes over and over that we already have you give us cards we needü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø"
"US","1","2025-03-25","1.1.2","KGenuineReviews","Hopeless Pull Rates","I always wish I could write better things about this game, but the non-guaranteed pull rates take all the life out of it. People even understand the developers need to make money, but that can be done with integrity. My favorite Pok√©mon is Chimchar, so I‚Äôve tried to make it feel like a fun adventure to collect each member of its family (related cards). I‚Äôve been opening packs for them for nearly 2 full months, and the last one (181/155 Infernape ex) is still basically just as far away as it was at the start. Pack points being separated by set force players into rigid choices for how they want to play. Wonder Picks are becoming more diluted with every passing set, so you will never even see the cards you really want and feel out of reach in the packs. The only adventure here is a sad gambling experience I can‚Äôt justify putting money and resources into when it is totally random and feels bad most of the time. I have been advocating for methods to allow select and limited themes (typing/evolution family/etc.) to receive bonus rates in packs through your activity and time spent in the game. Every game I‚Äôve ever played online was with Fire types, and since it was first available, the Chimchar family. All of that enthusiasm and love gets lost in the teeth of greed just to force the maximum possible profit out of people. Well, guess what? I hope my story resonates with people so that more people turn away from spending to spare themselves the heartbreak and disappointment. You can make a brighter future for yourself without endlessly missing out on the cards you want, I believe in you. Maybe when the system is fairer and even slightly more customizable to your particular joys and interests, I will consider revising all of my statements about this game and the status of Pok√©mon in general."

"US","4","2025-03-25","1.1.2","Filthykraken","Good but could be better","I enjoy the game a lot. Here are some ideas on possible changes in the future. Adding more solo battles. I really enjoy those. Second, could be the option to chat with another play or at least add an option to select a card you‚Äôd like to trade with and for. I don‚Äôt want to send random cards to people and get something way less of value back. Let us put the card we are looking for in and/or an option to enter the card we are willing to trade, then people can offer what they want or have. Those are my gripes. I have yet to trade due to that. Or give us an option to send a message, even if it‚Äôs a premade message, I understand children are on this game and understand they probably don‚Äôt want to open that type of communication window to kids. But my suggestion may make it a better and more friendly place to trade."
"US","1","2025-03-25","1.1.2","This guy talking","Nothing crazy","Once the thrill wears off, you‚Äôre basically opening 1 real pack of cards a day, except instead of you owning the cards, Nintendo and TPC still do, so really, this isn‚Äôt really anything. I can‚Äôt trade whatever for whatever, I‚Äôm limited to VERY exclusive rules and not everything can be traded. Even though it‚Äôs a TRADING CARD GAME. This flies in the face of the whole idea behind Pokemon, and it‚Äôs clear that capitalism and investors pockets are more important than the pocket monsters themselves. For shame."

It‚Äôs almost as if no thought went into this feature. You will end up guessing, and ‚Äútrading blind.‚Äù So many missed opportunities with trading, and you didn‚Äôt even have to reinvent the wheel, it‚Äôs been properly done already by others.

Otherwise, a near perfect game, on all other levels. Well done!"

"US","4","2025-03-24","1.1.2","Spiderlilles","Love the game just wish there was some tweaks","I love this game like I said I like that I don&#39;t really have to go out and buy packs as a broke person. But like with the trading system I have some big issues that when you get a new pack you can trade your stuff and things. I hate that they have any restrictions one of it has 2 stars you can&#39;t trade because in real life I could go trade it. I Also don&#39;t like like you have to do one card at a time. I don&#39;t know. Just wish there was less restrictions for trading."
"US","1","2025-03-24","1.1.2","KaijuLeo","The management is too greedyÔºÅ","The game is pretty good, but the management is a big idiot. The expansion packs are updated too quickly. I haven&#39;t collected many decks and haven&#39;t played them. Then the next more powerful expansion pack comes out. At this time, I have to draw new card packs. I collected them quickly and spent some money. Now I am level 48. There are still a few interesting decks with bad cards. There is no guarantee for drawing cards. Is the trading system made by idiots? If you want to change cards, you have to disassemble the existing cards? If you see this comment, please don&#39;t spend money on this game. The management is too greedy."
"US","2","2025-03-24","1.1.2","JustAGuyWithAngerIssues","This game is so annoyingly unfair","This game is so annoyingly unfair that I just got sick of it and deleted. There is no balance of anything in this game. There are so many unfairly strong and just straight up not fair things in this game. Another annoying thing is the coin flip system: it‚Äôs so unfairly bad. I could keep going on but there‚Äôs too much but my point is that a lot of stuff in this game is so unfair and unbalanced that it just gets annoying because it isn‚Äôt very fun anymore. But that‚Äôs my opinion you can think however you want about this game I just wanted let people know what I think."

"US","3","2025-03-24","1.1.2","Notlgn","It‚Äôs fine.","I‚Äôd say overall it‚Äôs fine. But I have a huge issue with the rewards for event being wonder pick hourglasses. The whole wonderpick system is pretty lame and I don‚Äôt even bother. 1 you have to have numerous friends so broaden the rarity of cards you‚Äôll MAYBE find. 2 the packs that are shown for wonderpick, there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôs the most recent one. I had opened a ten pack, got nothing of course cause I spent money, and then my free pack afterward was a god pack, im talking all two stars and a crown rarity. But when all my friends checked their wonderpicks, it shower packs from my 10 pull and not my god pack. A terrible system that no one really talks about. 
I don‚Äôt even have to get in to trading. You already have heard the backlash about that. This is the Pokemon Buying Card Game. Not trading. 

Nevertheless I‚Äôve spent over 1000 on this game. Card packs are fun to open no matter what fluff they try to build around it. Like it said. It‚Äôs just fine."

"US","1","2025-03-24","1.1.2","Bl00dyGh0st","Started out fine, gotten worse","The most recent pack pulls have been horrible, I‚Äôm pulling the same cards over and over again without anything new or worth anything. Wonder picks have gone downhill too, can‚Äôt get anything from there when that was my go to to find cards that I haven‚Äôt pulled yet. It takes so long to get a restock on hourglasses and such so you are just waiting for something interesting to happen with nothing to do. Solo battles are nothing but frustrating, especially with the newer ones. It‚Äôs like there are times where the  game is too easy, win after win, and then you log on to play later and you are getting first places at least ten times in a row, not getting any cards that you need, the opposite of the coin sides that you need and overall getting you dominated over and over again without being able to actually play. Yet the bot will get and have everything it needs before you can even pull two basic Pok√©mon. This game is based on luck, and whether or not it wants to give you anything, not strategy. Do better, I wish I could give this game 0 stars"
